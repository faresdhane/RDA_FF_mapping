Active Data Management Plans IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/active-data-management-plans.html,yes,"Researchers are being required to create Data Management Plans (DMP) within a project proposal or for depositing data with a repository. Currently DMPs tend to be short (e.g. 2 pages), created at the proposal stage of a project, do not evolve and cannot be monitored in detail. 
The DMP should ensure that data is appropriately managed, archived, preserved and available for re-use and should be an integral part of the lifecycle of datasets. At various stages there are unique opportunities to capture the information necessary for re-use of the data. Examples of such information include syntactical and semantic descriptions, algorithms, provenance etc. Data should have Active DMPs which capture these types of information as fully as possible and can be extended by the custodians of the data in the future. 
Feedback from users (data repositories, funding agencies, researchers) indicates that most DMPs are inadequate for their requirements and do not support data re-use over the longer term. The ADMPIG and the related working groups will be a nucleus for discussion to identify the requirements and developments needed to support active (i.e. able to evolve and be monitored) data management planning to ensure the availability of the data for future re-use.

Objectives
Preliminary ideas around the concept of ADMPs and potential topics for the working groups have been identified. These include
1)	reviewing existing best practice for data management planning where this is already in place
2)	identifying the requirements for active data management plans across the complete spectrum of users (researchers, repositories, funding agencies etc.)
3)	specifying practical tools and services to support the data creators and their organizations in creating data management plans and also the data managers and funders that have a requirement to administer and monitor these plans.  
4)	define specific interfaces and exchange formats to ensure the interoperability of support tools and systems where necessary

Activities
«	Meeting notes and other relevant material published on the RDA wiki
«	Regular virtual meetings to keep up the progress of the group between plenaries.
 Relationship to other RDA interest and working groups
The ADMP IG will work with other groups where there are common interests. During an initial assessment of the other RDA groups the following groups were identified as being directly relevant to the on-going development of the active data management planning process:  
«	RDA/WDS Certification of Digital Repositories IG/ Domain Repositories IG 
«	ADMPIG will work with the RDA/WDS Certification of Digital Repositories IG to identify the requirements for data management plans by the repositories and also identify how they can support the researcher in identifying a suitable approved archive for the data as part of the DMP process
«	Metadata IG 
«	ADMPIG will work with the Metadata IG to discuss standards for capturing metadata for the data sets in a format this is required by the repositories and supports future re-use of the data
«	Preservation e-Infrastructure IG 
«	ADMPIG will work with the PeIIG to develop ideas for e-Infrastructure to support preservation

«	RDA/WDS Certification IG 
«	ADMP-IG will work with the RDA/WDS Certification IG to ensure that the information needed to support preservation is captured

«	Practical Policies
«	ADMP-IG will ensure that capture of policies is integrated into ADMPs as appropriate

«	Domain Repositories IG 
«	ADMP-IG will work with the Domain Repositories IG to ensure requirements from domain repositories is captured in ADMPs
Participants
There are currently 118 members signed up to the RDA Active Data Management Plans IG. The sessions led by the ADMP IG during previous plenaries have been well attended and generated a lot of interest."
Research data needs of the Photon and Neutron Science community IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/research-data-needs-photon-and-neutron-science-community.html,no,"Status: Recognized & Endorsed 

This Interest Group will focus on data related issues of science applications associated with large scale source facilities, including: synchrotron x-ray sources, free-electron laser x-ray sources, reactor and spallation neutron sources, muon sources, large electron microscope, NMR and high-powered laser facilities, which are used typically for investigations into the structure of matter at micro or nano scale.  

These facilities are characterised by a central facility providing access to scarce and specialised instruments which are typically beyond the means of single research groups, and are thus shared and used by many research teams to conduct experiments.  These experiments come from a wide range of disciplines including chemistry, biochemistry, pharmaceuticals, biology, metallurgy, engineering, materials science, palaeontology and archaeology. The user communities are rather heterogeneous, volatile and globally distributed. Issues to be tackled are hence bound to be global and interdisciplinary requiring a decent level of standardization and interoperability. "
Chemistry Research Data IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/chemistry-research-data-interest-group.html,yes,"Introduction: We are proposing a Chemistry Research Data Interest Group under the auspices of the Research Data Alliance (RDA), to foster diverse professional exchange on issues particular to data originating from the field of chemistry. Chemistry, as one of the central sciences, has fundamental impact on the fields of health, pharmaceuticals, materials, energy and many other applied sciences. There is a wealth of chemical data in various heterogeneous formats, distributed across a myriad of systems with endless potential for reuse in chemistry research and many related domains. However, many social, technical and administrative factors have limited the opportunities for open sharing and interoperable exchange.

The high reuse value of chemical information has sparked decades of innovative technologies addressing various challenges in handling chemical specific data, but very few approaches have persisted, are extensible beyond specific data types and/or are operable at scale. There is demonstrable need for coordinated development of updated and scaled infrastructures, hard and soft, for enabling chemical data exchange and connecting data providers with data users across sources and applications. The RDA mission is to build the social and technical bridges that enable open sharing of data. Organizing a forum for professional exchange directed at addressing opportunities and challenges for chemistry data management within the RDA framework will support international participation across a broad range of stakeholders and foster connections with data types and user scenarios in many disciplines. Bringing in IUPAC (International Union of Pure & Applied Chemistry) as co-sponsor of the group would clearly bridge the activities of this group between those of RDA and the responsible standards body for chemistry.

User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address: In response to many scientific, technical, and socioeconomic drivers, research chemists, chemical educators and chemical information specialists are recognizing the necessity to move forward with infrastructures, best practices, and cultural shifts to support consistent data management and sharing practices. Research funding agencies are increasingly requiring openly accessible research data and are looking to the scientific research communities to develop domain-appropriate criteria. Professional societies recognize the benefits in encouraging chemistry professionals to be experts in handling electronic data and documentation, and supporting these skills in professional education. Increasing opportunities for low-barrier technical solutions are opening up the market for electronic based information and data flow through electronic notebooks, automated data collection and analysis, data repositories and citation networks.

The importance of chemical data has long been recognized by science communities and centuries-old efforts in indexing and repackaging chemical data from primary literature into expansive collections that support innovation across many disciplines. However, there are many challenges to meet increasing demands for open research data deposit and maximizing machine operable data exchange. Working with chemistry research data often involves extensive consideration of contextual factors and layers of interpretive technologies. Divergent high-touch workflows have evolved to manage data in the existing collections. Long traditions of small laboratory culture and strong proprietary and commercial value impact the overall adoption and incorporation of open data exchange and high performance computing directly in research chemistry outside of a few sub-disciplines (e.g. drug discovery). As already experienced in many networking venues amidst chemical information professionals, an international Interest Group that spans a range of professional perspectives and expertise can provide much needed opportunity for fostering convergent and informed discussions.

Objectives: At some level, chemistry information is ubiquitous to every wet science laboratory and many theoretical research problems as well. The high value and wide applicability of chemical data generally has ensured a landscape of numerous and scattered, thoughtful and variously adopted –best practices”. Many venerable research and scientific publishing institutions and disciplinary data projects are involved in reviewing and managing data of high utility and have influential roles in long-standing community standards of practice around data use in the discipline. To maximize on the knowledge potential of the discipline, we are interested in approaching the functionality of data from several angles, including domain scope, infrastructure, and community practice. Specifically we propose to:

    Characterize different chemical data types of interest, identify critical points in the data life-cycle from instrument to publication, compile data management criteria in practice, map gaps in interoperability and opportunity potential for standards and other infrastructures, and prioritize outreach approaches and tools for researchers, primary publishers, data compilers, and others who manage chemistry research data.
    Leverage effort from all parties to establish metadata standards, ontologies and other soft infrastructures for chemical data that are adaptable for different application purposes
    Examine current research workflows in various research domains that interact with chemical data to support minimal disruption, encourage development of best practices and lower barriers to adoption. Particular attention will be given to engaging instrument manufacturers in the discussions, as they represent a good target to reduce the barriers to storing both data and metadata early in the research workflow.
    Cultivate sharing culture among researchers working in chemistry related fields by demonstrating potential innovations based on reusable chemical data.

Participation: There is increasing interest within RDA to engage with domain-based initiatives and data-driven organizations. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is a long-standing professional international organization with vested interest in supporting broad dissemination and usability of chemical data through development of standards and recommended practices. IUPAC engages members from adhering organizations in over 50 countries and is associated with over 30 international scientific organizations. Positioning this initiative as a joint RDA/IUPAC interest group will enable us to leverage the mechanisms and infrastructure of both international working member organizations to facilitate global input, dissemination and practical implementation of initiatives.

Potential Interest Group members hail from a range of professions and sectors that intersect chemistry research data, including experimental and theoretical researchers, educators, data and information scientists, librarians, publishers, database providers, and many others in academic, industrial, private and public sectors worldwide.  Many are active in professional groups with expertise in chemistry data, including the American Chemical Society (ACS) Division of Chemical Information (CINF), the Royal Society of Chemistry Society (RSC) Chemical Information and Computer Applications Group (CICAG), the Chemical Structure Association (CSA Trust), the German Chemical Society, the Chemical Society of Japan, the Chinese Chemical Society, among others. Opportunities exist to participate regularly in the technical programming and social networks of these organizations to further engage chemistry researchers and information professionals.

Outcomes: Understanding current data management practices (in the broadest sense) and perceived gaps across the chemistry discipline is key for targeted action. Suggested documentation projects of potential interest and value for the community include:

    Collect top five priority outcomes from members with rationale; from these identify commonalities and diversities for the group and the chemical information and data management professions writ large; collect at discussion events and consider a survey question for new members
    Identify and characterize existing systems and solutions relevant to chemistry and the interests that arise in the survey, including existing disciplinary data repositories, ontologies, and other community data projects
    Identify and compare funding agency requirements internationally that potentially involve chemistry data
    Determine what chemistry analysis instruments are already doing in taking data, what file formats are in use? What metadata commonalities, diversity? Proprietary data, format issues?
    Survey top chemistry publishers of the various types of data that are included with manuscripts as supplemental information
    Others as they arise from discussion

Mechanism: Discussions of interest initiated at the ACS meetings in March 2015 and August 2015 sparked a proposal for a BoF session at the September RDA Plenary in Paris to seek input on formulating a mechanism for a group. Further international outreach is planned through meetings and technical symposia at the multi-national chemical societies Pacifichem meeting in December 2015 and the ACS meeting in March 2016. Additional programming will be proposed with other societies and meetings. Monthly virtual meetings and regular inclusive communication channels will be established in the fall. Additional meetings focused on specific outcomes will be scheduled as needed.

Geospatial IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/geospatial-ig.html,yes,"

The Geospatial Interest Group (IG) addresses all issues related to data representing locations in space and/or time (in the sequel, for simplicity, termed –geospatial data”). Such data are present in virtually all sciences ? a proverbial statement says that 80% of all data is spatially referenced. Both sensors (like GPS in cars or satellite cameras) and simulations (such as weather forecasts) generate an ever-increasing wealth of such data which scientists are most keen to leverage. However, severe challenges are associated with capturing, managing, and analyzing geospatial data ? effectively, often they are –Big Data” with all sorts and combinations of volume, velocity, variety, and veracity issues. When being used these data frequently face disciplinary, organizational, or simply legacy obstacles.

The Geospatial IG aims at gathering all major stakeholders involved along the geospatial data value chain. It will take stock of existing issues, standards, and experiences. In doing so it will not only consolidate, but also contribute own original findings where possible. Areas addressed include the following (with an initial question added that aims at sparkling discussion to eventually crystalize WG topics):

à      geospatial data modeling, management, analyzing, and sharing;

Initial question: –why canêt we correlate two datasets offered by different data centers in different domains (such as satellite data centers and climate data centers)?”

Initial WG topic suggested: –Leveraging OGC Big Geo Data standards for INSPIRE ? a case study for SDIs”.

à      uncertainty in datasets;

Initial question: –How does uncertainty add to uncertainty in a processing chain step?”

Initial WG topic suggested: –Interoperablity testbed to understand uncertainity issues in multiscale Geospatial Data analysis (use cases: Transport, En?vir?on?ment)”

à      geospatial data re-use across domains, and cross-domain interoperability of location information;

Initial question: –how can we exchange data between domains X and Y, where X and Y are RDA IGs with geospatial data?”

Initial WG topic suggested: –Interoperability experiment on geo data and services provided by RDA IG/WG members”.

Due to this overarching perspective, and long-term perspective of these challenges, the topic requires an IG to be established rather than a short-term, narrow WG. The Geospatial IG itself will spin off Working Groups (WGs) to address topics of interest that have been isolated by the IG itself and its collab?or?ation with other RDA groups expressing needs in geospatial data handling. For example, developments in standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) allow the implementation of geospatial web services, enabling GIS •mashupsê to be seamlessly assembled by combining datasets from various sources and semantic frameworks. However, to derive intelligent outcomes there needs to be understanding on the methodologies to quantify the uncertainties of the spatial data that these results produce. Conversely, the IG serves as a competence center for geospatial issues within RDA.

Within RDA, the Geospatial IG sees manifold connections to other groups, including but not limited to: metadata, citation, publishing, context, Big Data Analytics, agriculture, urban data. By participation in the group meetings common interests will be scouted and approached continuously, and liaison will be established ideally by pairing a Geospatial IG member with a member of the target group; eventually, cross-IG WGs may emerge this way.

The Geospatial IG does not compete with any existing activity the domain. Rather, efforts will be made to get an active participation of the major international institutions like OGC, ICA, OSGeo, GEO, ESSI/AGU, EarthCube, AGILE, and relevant W3C community groups (Cartography, Geometry API, Geospatial Semantic Web, Places, SVG mapping, Location and Addresses). Notably, OGC and OSGeo are already represented by the initial proposers; further personal liaisons will be sought by inviting RDA members involved in the target body into the IG.

Once the IG is established we will invite the community to propose WGs in their areas of interest and these WGs will then be working on producing key outputs as agreed in the WG workplans along the timeframes specified.

The Geospatial IG will be co-ordinated by a Chair and three Co-Chairs, initially these individuals:

à      Suchith Anand (UK) chair

à      Peter Baumann  (Germany); co-chair

à      Luciene Delazari (Brazil); co-chair

à      Andrea Perego (Italy); co-chair 

The list of currently 60 members of the IG-to-be shows a broad coverage of all continents (except Antarctica), which will be mobilized to leverage its diverse expertise within RDA as well as its geographic spread for global outreach.

Telecons and face-to-face meetings of the group and of eventual working groups will be organised alongside the regular RDA meetings and also at other meetings (for example in parallel to ICA, OSGeo conferences). The Interest Group will use the RDA structures for on line collaboration between the face to face meetings."
Global Water Information IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/global-water-information-interest-group.html-0,no,"The proposed Global Water Information Interest Group (GWIIG) will serve as a platform leading to formation of RDA working group; as a venue for communication among RDA WGs and IGs focused on both technical eInfrastructure aspects (e.g. brokering; metadata and catalogs, dynamic data citation) and on related research domains (e.g. geosciences, agriculture, biodiversity); and as a coordination mechanism across a wide group of water information stakeholders, in particular those not previously involved in the OGC/WMO water standardization work."
"ESIP/RDA Earth, Space, and Environmental Sciences IG",https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/esiprda-earth-space-and-environmental-sciences-ig,yes,"Introduction (A brief articulation of what issues the IG will address, how this IG is aligned with the RDA mission, and how this IG would be a value-added contribution to the RDA community):

The Earth, space, and environmental science communities are developing, through multiple international efforts, both general and domain-specific leading practices for data management, infrastructure development, vocabularies, and common data/digital services. This Interest Group will work towards coordinating and harmonizing these efforts to reduce possible duplication, increase efficiency, share use cases, and promote partnerships and adoption in the community.

 

User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address (what triggered the desire for this IG in the first place):

This Interest Group builds on the BOF specific to EarthCube held at the RDA P10 meeting.  Results from that session showed strong interest in intenational collaboration for Earth, space, and environmental infrastructure concerns that are currently be addressed in RDA across all the sciences and external to RDA across many geographically oriented efforts. 

Key participating groups and their use cases include:

1. The Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) is expanding to include communities outside of the United States.  Specifically the next area of growth is Australia.  ESIP is an independent forum used to address topics of interest to the Earth science data and technology community, such as data management, data citation and documentation. The work of the ESIP community is advanced through our collaboration areas, where participants contribute their expertise toward resolving common problems of the Earth science data and technology community.

2. The Australian AuScope program provides research infrastructure to the Earth and Geospatial Science research communities with a focus on data discovery, delivery and interoperability with an increasing focus on FAIR data principles.  AuScope has been developing related data and interoperability platforms for the last decade and is currently focusing on increased international collaboration.  AuScope is Federally funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure (NCRIS) program.

3.  The European Union funded European Plate Observing System (EPOS) is in the midst of its implementation phase, with increasing interest to be interoperable with their international counterparts. EPOS, the European Plate Observing System, is a long-term plan to facilitate integrated use of data, data products, and facilities from distributed research infrastructures for solid Earth science in Europe.

4.  The American Geophysical Union (AGU) is leading an international community-driven effort, Enabling FAIR Data, to adopt existing and develop new leading practices that result in data supporting a publication to be preserved in an appropriate repository with proper data citations placed in the reference. Data will no longer be in the supplement of the paper. This effort seeds to coordinate across similar and supporting efforts. Partners include RDA, ESIP, ANDS, NCI, AuScope, Nature, Science, PNAS, and the Center for Open Science.

5. The Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) is an NSF-funded project meant to accelerate curation and archive of environmental data, emphasizing data from projects funded by the NSF DEB.  Programs served include Long Term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB), Organization for Biological Field Stations (OBFS), Macrosystems Biology (MSB), and Long Term Ecological Research (LTER).

6.  The U. S. National Science FoundationÕs EarthCube effort is moving into implementation phase and reaching out internationally to be informed and coordinate efforts. EarthCube, initiated by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2011, transforms geoscience research by developing cyberinfrastructure to improve access, sharing, visualization, and analysis of all forms of geosciences data and related resources.  

7. The Open Geospatial Consortium has a series of Domain Working Groups including Earth Systems, Geoscience, Hyrdology and Marine. These Domain Working Groups provide a forum for discussion of key interoperability requirements and issues, discussion and review of implementation specifications, and presentations on key technology areas relevant to solving geospatial interoperability issues. However, their supporters come mainly from the Government and Industry Sectors, and it is hoped by linking through this interest group there will be greater connectivity to those equivalent activities in the academic/research sector.

 

Objectives (A specific set of focus areas for discussion, including use cases that pointed to the need for the IG in the first place.   Articulate how this group is different from other current activities inside or outside of RDA.):

This Interest Group will focus on awareness and coordination where applicable of dependent efforts across the international Earth, space, and environmental science communities.

 

This group is different from other current activities as it is focused on the scientific domains specific to the Earth, space, and environmental sciences.  Some overlap potentially exists with interdisciplinary work in the biological community and social science community.

 

Within RDA, we will leverage the existing working groups and interest groups to help integrate and coordinate the needs of the Earth, space, and environmental sciences with the objectives and deliverables across those related efforts.

Physical Samples and Collections in the Research Data Ecosystem IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/physical-samples-and-collections-research-data-ecosystem-ig,yes,"Name of Proposed Interest Group:   Physical Samples and Collections in the Research Data Ecosystem
 
Introduction (A brief articulation of what issues the IG will address, how this IG is aligned with the RDA mission, and how this IG would be a value-added contribution to the RDA community):

Physical samples are a basic element for reference, study, and experimentation in research.  Tests and analysis are conducted directly on samples, such as biological specimens, rock or mineral specimens, soil or sediment cores, plants and seeds, water quality samples, archeological artefacts, or DNA and human tissue samples, because they represent a wider population or a larger context. Other physical objects, such as maps or analog images are also direct objects of study, and, if digitized, may become a source of digital data. There is an urgent need for better integrating these physical objects into the digital research data ecosystem, both in a global and in an interdisciplinary context to support search, retrieval, analysis, reuse, preservation and scientific reproducibility. This group aims to facilitate cross-domain exchange and convergence on key issues related to the digital representation of physical samples and collections, including but not limited to use of globally unique and persistent identifiers for samples to support unambiguous citation and linking of information in distributed data systems and with publications, metadata standards for documenting samples and collections and for landing pages, access policies, and best practices for sample and collection catalog, including a broad range of issues from interoperability to persistence.

A growing community of stakeholders, comprising domain scientists, collection curators, information scientists, data managers, all working at the interface with computational science, are developing detailed practices and standards around identifiers, vocabularies, and software interfaces, which are necessary for wider community application. Publishers and funders represent additional stakeholders interested in best practices for sample citation and registration of sample metadata in online catalogs that are fundamental for reproducibility of sample-based data and future use of valuable collection specimens. Currently, these efforts are fragmented, as is the communication of technical solutions and organizational best practices. This IG will support cross-disciplinary and international dialog helping to build technical and social bridges among a broad range of stakeholders to align and coordinate ongoing efforts, strengthen solutions, and broaden their adoption.

At RDA Plenary 4 and Plenary 6 Bird of Feather sessions were held that already gathered an international and multi-disciplinary group of stakeholders. A preliminary case statement was reviewed by participants in the P6 BoF and informed the current version.


User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address (what triggered the desire for this IG in the first place):
 
Best practices, standards, and infrastructure are needed to properly link physical samples and collections to digital data generated by their study or to features in the real world. Samples need to be cited with globally unique, persistent, and resolvable identifiers in publications to ensure that they can be unambiguously linked to online metadata profiles (landing pages) and to other data generated by other studies of the same sample. Scientists want to search for data for a given sample across the entire literature. This can now be achieved as sample PIDs can be included in publication DOIs or data DOIs as related identifiers that can be harvested and searched through systems like SCHOLIX. Scientists also want to find out where a given sample can be accessed to reproduce data or add new measurements to the available knowledge about a sample. Both the approaches to, and maturity of technical and organizational solutions and infrastructure differ across the many disciplines that work with physical samples. Diverse and uncoordinated practices make it difficult to advance the adoption of best practices that link physical samples to the digital research data ecosystem. Further, commercial software providers for museum and collection catalogs and publishers are reluctant to implement best practices if they are different and incompatible across domains.
 
Objectives (A specific set of focus areas for discussion, including use cases that pointed to the need for the IG in the first place.   Articulate how this group is different from other current activities inside or outside of RDA.):
RDA presents a multi-disciplinary and international community engaged in research data management that presents a unique opportunity for the goals of this IG. The objectives of this IG are:
1.	Identify commonalities and diversities across the stakeholders and establish prioritized action items that are appropriate for Working Groups. Relevant issues are: unique sample identifiers; sample documentation including vocabularies and taxonomies and alignment with international metadata standards; sample registration and interoperability of digital online catalogs; policies for sample citation in publications; and access to samples and sample metadata.
2.	Identify and characterize existing systems and solutions relevant to linking physical samples with digital research data; identify gaps and challenges.
3.	Facilitate international cooperation to develop harmonized approaches and best practices for physical object identification and digital curation; enable the facilitation of object and sample identification infrastructure both at the national and international levels.
4.	Build linkages between object repositories and museums, digital data repositories, scientific publications, museum software providers, and science communities.

Participation (Address which communities will be involved, what skills or knowledge should they have, and how will you engage these communities.  Also address how this group proposes to coordinate its activity with relevant related groups.):
Communities that will be involved in this IG range from museum and collection curators, to research data managers, researchers in domain sciences, information sciences, and computer sciences, to publishers and funders.

Life Science Data Infrastructures IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/life-science-data-infrastructures-ig,yes,"The life sciences are becoming increasingly data intensive, owing much to the huge improvements seen in large-scale gene sequencing and other molecular ÒomicsÓ techniques. There is a need for large-scale sustainable and interoperable data management and storage methods that allow secure and easy access to and reuse of these highly complex data. Simultaneously, as omics-focussed life science research projects increasingly depend on more than one type of measurement, there is a widely felt need for the ability to integrate different data types. Phenotyping, bioimaging and biosample management can all be considered part of life science data, and omics-focussed life science data systems will need to interoperate with these. Different and diverse sectors of the life sciences, such as health, food production, bioindustry and the environment experience similar issues. Interoperability between different research domains is thus a necessary condition to allow for the emergence of cross-disciplinary data. It is no surprise that the life sciences gave birth to the FAIR principles. 

The Life Science Data Infrastructures Interest Group is formed to serve as a bridge between life science data infrastructures in different regions of the world and relevant RDA Interest Groups, including both specific subtopics of the life sciences such as agricultural data, marine data, structural biology, toxicogenomics, as well as generic topics that can/should be applied in the life sciences such as big data analysis, federated identity management, and data publishing.
The IG aspires to have meaningful representation from diverse geographical regions including North and South America, the EU, UK and Eastern Europe; Africa, Asia and Oceania; and will actively seek participation from under-represented groups and the global South. The IG also aims for fair gender representation and inclusivity in all its activities. 
Collaborating Life Science Infrastructures
The interest group is currently an initiative of four regional infrastructure organisations:

?	ELIXIR (http://www.elixir-europe.org/) has been established to build a sustainable pan-European research infrastructure for biological information providing support to life science research including medicine, agriculture, bioindustry and society. ELIXIR did originally take the initiative for this IG that started in 2014 as the ELIXIR Bridging Force IG and grew into the Life Science Data Infrastructures IG from initiatives in 2019.

?	The Australian BioCommons (https://www.biocommons.org.au/) is building digital infrastructure to ensure Australian life science research remains globally competitive, by providing access to the tools, methods and training researchers require to respond to national challenges such as food security, environmental conservation and disease treatment

?	In the USA, representation is through NIH Office of Data Science Strategy (https://datascience.nih.gov). Support for life science data infrastructure includes the Science and Technology Research Infrastructure for Discovery, Experimentation, and Sustainability (STRIDES) Initiative. STRIDES allows researchers to explore the use of cloud environments to streamline data use by partnering with commercial providers, Google, AWS and Microsoft Azure. Leveraging the STRIDES partnership with cloud service providers, NIHÕs is connecting our various data systems in a critical step toward improving researchersÕ access to all types of data. The NIH Cloud Platform Interoperability (NCPI) effort seeks to create a federated genomic data ecosystem and is a collaborative project between NIH and external partners (https://datascience.nih.gov/nih-cloud-platform-interoperability-effort). 

?	H3ABioNet (https://www.h3abionet.org) was established to develop bioinformatics capacity in Africa and specifically to enable genomics data analysis by H3Africa researchers across the continent. It has developed several key resources to serve African genomics data to the global scientific community.

At any time, this list will be open to other regional initiatives with a compatible remit. At no time will there be any limitations to membership of the interest group; this list only exists to provide an anchor to regional implementation of data standards in the life sciences.
Existing collaborations
There are existing international collaborations on sub-topics of life science data for which we will make sure of appropriate representation in our RDA IG. Examples are:
?	Global BioData Coalition (https://globalbiodata.org/), on sustainability of core data resources.
?	Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (https://www.ga4gh.org), on standards for human genomic data sharing.
?	Proteomics Standards Initiative (https://www.hupo.org/Proteomics-Standards-Initiative) 
Our continued collaboration with the RDA FAIRsharing WG (https://rd-alliance.org/group/fairsharing-registry-connecting-data-policies-standards-databases.html) will also ensure we connect with data resources and standardization initiatives in life science and beyond. 
Co-chairs
The IG will be organised by a group of co-chairs that is representative of the geographic diversity.

Until now, Rob Hooft, Carole Goble and Bengt Persson, all three representing Europe / ELIXIR, have been co-chairs of the Bridging Force IG. They will step down and leave the lead of the changed group to new candidates with the proposed transformation.

Candidates to take up the role of Co-chairs in 2022 are:
?	Jeff Christiansen; representing Australian BioCommons
?	Nicola Mulder; representing H3ABioNet
?	Rob Hooft; ad-interim representative of ELIXIR
?	Susan Gregurick; representing NIH.

Co-chairs will be proposed by the represented infrastructures, and appointed by approval of the membership of the IG; co-chairship will be reconsidered at least every three years.
Plans
Primary goal of the Interest Group will be to organise sessions at each plenary that focus on a (possibly timely) topic of interest to the participating infrastructures, and to bring together observations of interest from other sessions at the plenary. Secondary goals are to discuss problems encountered in life science data infrastructure in RDA context, and to make sure that RDA results are adopted in the life sciences where appropriate.

When a topic requires more in-depth examination, the setup of an RDA Working group will be considered. Topics could include:
?	Interoperability of different kinds of large-scale (ÒomicsÓ) data
?	Sustainability of life science data identifiers
?	Mechanisms for secure access to personal data, including authorisation and authentication issues
?	Strategies for data storage allowing for computationally intensive analyses
?	Distributed/federated data analysis

The tasks of the Life Science Data Infrastructures IG will be performed where possible in collaboration with other RDA Interest Groups and Working Groups."
Biodiversity Data Integration IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/biodiversity-data-integration-ig.html,yes,"Introduction
Disciplinary groups play a pivotal role in the RDA ecosystem. Not only do they provide a
mechanism for engaging with the outputs of the RDA community, they are instrumental
in providing input to the cross-cutting technical and socio-cultural groups. With its
formation in 2013, t he Biodiversity Data Integration IG has been one of the pioneering
groups in RDA, focusing from the outset on linking the wider communities of practice in the
biodiversity data domain with experts and other communities within RDA.
The COVID-19 outbreak was a game changer that will have a permanent effect on digital
strategies. It has made it abundantly clear that the domain needs to expand its digital
strategies beyond simply adding content online. This includes strengthening relationships
with our audiences, supporting the development of people and their digital skills, evaluating
joint policies and the ability to evaluate choices in the ever changing technology landscape.
The BDI IG aims to be a platform for discussion and development of recommendations and
guidance that can help institutions and researchers in the domain in their digital
transformation.
This charter has been updated because there are many developments in the field of
biodiversity data now that would benefit with alignment of developments in other scientific
domains and vice versa. Examples are the global movement to FAIR data, implementing RDA
recommendations towards a FAIR DO infrastructure for specimens with Natural Science
Identifiers, an extended Catalogue of Life and the establishment of a Global Alliance for
Biodiversity Knowledge.
Objectives
The group aims to steer discussion and coordinate efforts that create synergies among
infrastructure developments around biodiversity data, and to connect these with RDA
developments in the wider inter-disciplinary research infrastructure landscape.
Infrastructures cannot operate in isolation but need to be part of the same value chain
to deliver scientific outputs. This overall aim can be divided in three main objectives:
1. Impact/effect/influence and disseminate some of the wider RDA
discussion/work strands.
Many of the recommendations produced in RDA together are forming the
foundations for how to design and develop systems, workflows and policies in such a
way that data integration and interoperability problems can be overcome and
enable interdisciplinary science. These recommendations also work toward
establishing FAIRness of the data to enable Open Science. FAIRness means
1
compliance with the fifteen guiding principles of FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, and Reusable).
A recent survey carried out by the BDI IG indicated however that two-thirds of the
respondents from the Biodiversity data community are not yet aware of the RDA
recommendations. The group aims to discuss the impact/effect/influence of some of
the wider RDA discussion/work strands, such as data fabric, digital object
architecture, etc. and their implications for the biodiversity/geodiversity domain. The
BDI IG can then promote these recommendations further and write guidelines for
application in biodiversity data. For FAIR principles implementation, the BDI IG aims
to connect with the BiodiFAIRse Implementation Network in order to collectively
build communities of practice.
2. Crossbreed biodiversity standards and solutions with other domains.
The biodiversity data community itself has made significant progress on issues
like liberating biodiversity data from literature, semantic enhanced publishing,
community standards development procedures ( TDWG ), industrial scale
digitisation of objects, a common data exchange format ( DarwinCore Archives )
and community curation of data (using tools like WikiData , Catalogue Of Life
Clearinghouse ). The BDI IG aims to crossbreed biodiversity standards and
technology and produce neutral solutions with other domains in order to
achieve cross-domain interoperability. It may also disseminate the progress to
other disciplines and ultimately transform these into RDA recommendations for
cross-disciplinary use.
3. Create recommendations and guidelines for specific biodiversity data
integration issues.
As a third objective, the BDI IG aims to create recommendations and guidelines
specific for biodiversity data integration, e.g., the adoption of (TDWG) community
standards or community policies across biodiversity data infrastructures, or
guidelines for connecting biodiversity data through globally adopted solutions for
taxon names and persistent identifiers for occurrence records and specimens.
User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address
The use cases the IG wants to address have changed over time. This triggered an
update of this charter. The following areas were recently identified by the IG members:
? Data integration for biodiversity data
? Data integration through Natural Science Collections : Create recommendations
that enable linking data together using specimens (hard evidence) as the basis.
Several specifications and standards are already in place,e.g., DarwinCore , ABCD ,
EML , or in development, like OpenDS , MIDS , natural sciences identifiers ( NSId ), and
the digital specimen and extended specimen concepts. The BDI IG will be used as a
platform to discuss and enhance these as part of the wider RDA landscape.
2
? Data liberation from biodiversity literature, semantic enhanced publishing:
Establishment of the Biodiversity Heritage Library , TreatmentBank and integration of
liberated taxonomic treatments. GBIF has provided much experience in semantically
enhanced publishing, which can be disseminated further through the BDI IG and
through support of RDA groups working on developing cross-disciplinary
recommendations in this direction.
? Semantic initiatives for data integration : to semantically describe taxon traits,
phenomics, and interactions enabling the creation and visualization of linkages with
and between e.g. species and specimens.
? Increase usage of research data by biodiversity authorities : Biodiversity research data are
often not used by biodiversity authorities. The IG aims to promote adoption of RDA
recommendations that aid the discovery, usage, open data sharing and trust in these data by
these authorities. There is also a need to have a better understanding, from a policy
standpoint, on how biodiversity data can contribute to e.g., the Intergovernmental
Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services ( IPBES ) and the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ).
? Policies for referencing data : Development of best practices and community policies to refer
to biodiversity data using Persistent Identifiers (PIDs), which should influence requirements
set by publishers and funders. Recommendations should push prospective publishing,
making sure data are properly published from the scholarly and semantic point of view and
to ensure that such data can directly flow into infrastructures.
? Biodiversity data in Essential Biodiversity Variables ( EBV s) : The positioning of biodiversity
data in Òdata cubesÓ is unclear; standards and pipelines need to be identified in
collaboration with the monitoring and climate research domains and the Group on Earth
Observations Biodiversity Observation Network ( GEO BON ). See also the example of how
observation and specimen data can work together in one data cube specifically for creating
models and indicators.
? Develop guidelines to increase the synergy in achieving technology neutral solutions for
enhanced data quality : Data quality is a major concern in biodiversity informatics caused by
the distributed nature of data acquisition and digitization, and also by specific problems in
sub-domains, such as taxonomic data and geographic data. Initiatives like the Biodiversity
Data Quality Framework developed in Biodiversity Information Standards ( TDWG ) will only
work if synergy is achieved within the domain for implementing such solutions.
? Promote synergy between existing initiatives to foster community adoption and
experiences exchanges : There are several initiatives and communities of practice that can
contribute to foster community adoption of standards, as DataONE , LTER, iBOL, Map of Life,
GBIF, NEON, ALA, OBIS, BioCASe, iNaturalist, GEO BON . In that sense, promoting connections
will help to build a stronger network.
3
Participation
Participation in the group is open for anyone interested but is targeted to the
biodiversity data domain. Where there is overlap between biodiversity and other
domains, like earth science data in natural history collections, development of
guidelines may need to be done in conjunction with other RDA groups like the Physical
Samples and Collections IG.
The group has more than 150 members spread across the continents, including
international experts in many of the biodiversity subdomains. Africa is currently
underrepresented and should be targeted to balance the membership. The members
also aim to expand participation to global and regional biodiversity infrastructures, to
create better linkages with current developments in these infrastructures.
Outcomes
The BDI IG intends to be a platform for discussion and coordination of existing ongoing
initiatives, however also aims to establish some outputs in the form of guidelines or
recommendations. A number of examples have been recently mentioned that might
lead to WGS to produce these outputs. These are:
1. Guidelines for linking biodiversity data to ecosystem services assessments;
2. Guidelines about how to markup biodiversity-related websites, in collaboration
with Bioschemas' biodiversity group ;
3. Recommendations for synthesis under constant taxonomic change;
4. Recommendations/standards for metadata versioning and reconciliation;
5. Closing the taxonomic gap between biodiversity and agrobiodiversity;
6. Recommendations for real-time transaction based data publishing and
annotation;
7. Alignment on work for data standards to represent specimens as being carried
out in ABCD community, IGSN, DOI, TDWG, DiSSCo etc.;
8. Persistent species identifiers;
9. Recommendations for biological data standards for ecological data;
10. Recommendations for how to handle species absence data;
11. Best practices for interoperability between physical data standards (i.e., Climate
and Forecast) and biological data standards.
Mechanism
From the group objectives it is evident that links to other relevant RDA groups would be
key to the success of the BDI IG. These links need to be developed more. The BDI IG has
already been working together with ELIXIR Bridging Force IG (Life Science domain) and
organised joint sessions. Group members have been involved in biodiversity data
integration related work in other groups, like the RDA/TDWG WG on Metadata
Standards for attribution of physical and digital collections stewardship. But there are
4
many more opportunities. Ricarda Braukmann created a report 1 in which he
summarised the current RDA Interest and Working Groups and analyzed them with
respect to their relevance for social science researchers. The grouping in this report can
also be used to identify groups of relevance for linking with the BDI IG. The report lists
groups on general topics like policies and guidelines, data management and technical
infrastructure aspects. When working on one of the BDI IG use cases, group members
should use this overview to identify relevant groups and make a connection. Also, the
group should establish connections with the Disciplinary Collaboration Framework IG
which aims to bring together different research disciplines to discuss
disciplinary-specific use cases of RDA outputs. Other relevant groups are the Social
Dynamics of Data Interoperability IG, the Vocabulary Services IG and Sharing Rewards
and Credit (SHARC) IG. The group should also establish links with GO FAIR
Implementation Networks for biodiversity data like BiodiFAIRse, and, when endorsed,
with GO FAIR IG. The mechanism for creating the linkages with these groups will be
through organising joint sessions, group members participating in sessions of these
groups, and ultimately through the establishment of joint WGs.
The group aims to meet during the plenaries (physical meetings with remote
participants) but also to have virtual meetings in between the plenaries. The group
members have indicated that having more virtual meetings might create more
engagement and keep people close to the group between plenaries.
Where the group sessions at the plenaries may be more like dissemination events, the
virtual meetings in between will have the aim of working sessions on specific topics. In
general the group aims to develop activities that complement existing initiatives rather
than developing new initiatives. This can, for example, include initiatives already under
development in funded projects, infrastructures, standards development or other RDA
groups. For working sessions the group aims to be specific on how people can tangibly
contribute to the topic being worked on. Members are asked to accompany the
organisation of working sessions with specific documents or ideas so that people can
immediately interact.
Working groups may be established to work on larger tasks and produce tangible
outputs in the form of recommendations or guidelines. A few ideas for new working
groups have been proposed by the members:
? Minimum Information about a Digital Specimen recommendation (jointly with
TDWG & Physical Samples & Collections IG);
? Open Digital Specimens (openDS) recommendation (jointly with TDWG);
? Guidelines for specimens citation in publications.

DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3580674

Activities may also be aligned with or add to work being carried out in already existing
or past WGs. Examples are:
? I-ADOPT WG which aims at building an Interoperability Framework for describing
observable properties;
? RDA/TDWG Attribution Metadata Working Group (attribution standard is further
developed in TDWG).
To get a better understanding of the capacities of the group for development of
activities, the group created during P15 a list of initiatives we are involved in or know of.
Although such an overview rapidly gets outdated, it is helpful in identifying initial key
areas of work. The list can be found in the session notes .
Timeline
The main goals for 2020 are to reactivate the group, inventory the current needs for a
BDI interest group, update the charter and to identify key areas of work in current
initiatives. In 2021 this will be used to discuss further work in the identified areas and
establish working groups. Another goal for 2021 will be to create the connection with
the identified RDA IGs and WGs of relevance, and to strengthen the connections with
identified relevant initiatives in implementation networks and infrastructures.
Planned 2020 milestones:
? March: current interest group needs inventoried and discussed,
? June: draft updated Charter ready,
? September: group endorsed with updated charter,
? November (Plenary 16): first working group(s) established.
Planned 2021 milestones:
? First virtual working meeting in between plenaries organised,
? P17 and P18 joint sessions with one or two of the identified IGs of relevance,
? A P17 and/or P18 BDI IG session to disseminate WG results and/or establish new
WGs."
Research Data Management in Engineering IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/research-data-management-engineering-ig,yes,"Engineering comprises a vast span of sub-disciplines including for example chemical, civil,
electrical, and mechanical engineering. Traditionally, engineering disciplines apply scientific
knowledge and empirical evidence to finding (innovative) solutions in areas that range from
design, creating and building to production of software and innovative materials. Therefore,
research in engineering disciplines is highly multi-disciplinary and also works in close
collaboration with industry. Hence research data management practices within these
sub-disciplines tend to be unaligned with e.g. open data initiatives/requirements and the
implementation of the FAIR data principles. Publishing research data, code and workflows is
rarely considered even when the research has been completed and the economic interests
are secured. Engineers think and work for the future, but they usually do not think about
embargos for their data. Sharing data and information often just takes place in a closed user
group. The interpretation of Òas open as possibleÓ is in engineering more as closed as
possible.
The aims of the Interest Group ""Research Data Management in Engineering"" (IG RDM4Eng)
are changing the culture of handling data, creating awareness and bridging
(sub-)communities and existing initiatives, which often exist only within a research group.
Moreover, the IG will provide a platform for developing consensus on RDM best practices for
engineering and to find convincing arguments for engineers in academia and industry to
introduce or to improve RDM practices in their workflows.
User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address
The IG RDM4Eng wants to address the engineer-specific challenges and aspects on RDM
which are more often expected by research funding agencies and universities.
1. Challenges
? Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of the engineering research , a close attention
should be placed on the processes and workflows in order to define standards and
best practices.
? Attention must be paid not only to the research data per se , but also to all digital
objects which help the generation and the (re-)use of the data .
? Breaking up data silos is one of the major challenges.
? The close collaboration with industry can challenge researchers when confronting
funder/journals/institutional requirements regarding RDM or simply when trying to
follow the FAIR data principles.
? No awareness and missing standards and skills for data, code and workflow
publication as well as for FAIR and RDM workflow implementation are
controversial to the work of an engineer. Common to all engineers is that they work
with standards like ISO 8000 or ISO 9000 every day.
? There is no culture or community efforts to optimize or facilitate the sharing of
data with Òexternal researchersÓ or other research communities (i.e. intellectual
property rights are very relevant for researchers working in engineering).
1
Research Data Alliance Charter, May 2019
? Common interfaces and protocols for managing, accessing and re-using research
data from industry and academics are still missing . Each data provider has its own
service offering and returns data in different (proprietary) formats with different
licenses and costs. Additionally, commercial data providers are often constrained to
particular business sectors in specific geographical areas and keep their data locked
within isolated data sets.
2. Initial Use Cases to overcome the challenges
Wind Energy goes FAIR. This use case is supported by the researcher Nikola Vasiljevic
from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), who is also an RDA ambassador. It will
develop a set of practical solutions for securing a long-term FAIRness and interpretability of
(research) digital objects created in a typical lifecycle of wind energy projects. In particular,
we will focus on improving the interoperability, reusability, and interpretability of digital
objects generated in the research project ÔV52Õ (internally funded by DTU Wind Energy),
which produced extremely heterogeneous datasets (i.e. from meteorological data to SCADA
data ). The lack of a robust solution for preserving the knowledge that is generated in the
interaction with the datasets is a common challenge in this kinds of research projects which
produce large and complex datasets. Often there are no proper records of previously derived
data sets and/or they are not systematically organized. This means that each time a
researcher wants to re-use the data, the analysis starts from scratch. We will focus on
finding and implementing the most suitable data formats, data structures/organization and
naming conventions for recorded parameters in projects like ÔV52Õ. Whenever possible,
already existing conventions will be used. In case they do not exist (e.g. SCADA data), we
will propose naming conventions, standardized data formats and structures, which will be
discussed with the wind energy community. In this use case, relevant RDA
recommendations will be revised and whenever possible adopted to try to maximize the
re-usability of the data produced in the project 'V52'.
A second use case is the Collaborative Research Centre (SFB) 1313 ÒInterface-driven
multi-field processes in porous media,Ó located at the University of Stuttgart and supported
by the researcher Bernd Flemisch and research data manager Sibylle Hermann. Porous
media systems are highly relevant in a wide range of applications, including ecological,
technical and biological systems. Subsurface flow and transport processes, fuel cells, or
vertebroplasty are just a few examples. Around 50 researchers from 18 different institutes of
the University of Stuttgart and partners universities make up the team. A declared goal of the
SFB is the integration of physical/mathematical models and the resulting computational
models with high-resolution experiments.
The exchange, description and administration of data records is undertaken via the Data
Repository of the University of Stuttgart ( DaRUS ) as the central link, via which data records
can also be published directly. The automation of the data processes is regarded as
essential. Automation initially involves the acquisition of all relevant input and output data
that describe the respective experiment or simulation. In a further step, these data are
automatically described with the metadata schema EngMeta and stored together on DaRUS.
For the automated upload APIs of the underlying system Dataverse are used. The uploaded
data sets are to be enriched with visualizations that allow a quick preview of the data. In
order to ensure the reproducibility of simulation data, so-called software stacks are to be
2
Research Data Alliance Charter, May 2019
stored in form of containers that contain the complete operating system as well as all
packages and executables required for the execution of the simulation.
The emphasis in this use case is set on cooperation between infrastructure and researchers.
The development of interfaces between institute and university infrastructure can be used as
an example for the development of further interfaces. In addition, the interaction between
experiment and simulation is a widespread phenomenon in the engineering sciences, as it is
of utmost importance for the validation of computational models. So far, there are hardly any
efforts in integrating systematically experimental and simulation data for model validation.
Therefore, findings from the IG are to be incorporated into this use case, tested and
evaluated and can be presented as best practices.
Objectives
Possible objectives the IG RDM4Eng will work on:
? Bring together scientific and industrial stakeholders from all relevant sectors to
discuss their legal and technological challenges around RDM practices.
? Provide a forum for exchanging knowledge, options and experiences on a
national and international level.
? Bring light to the issue of contract- and mission-oriented engineering research
from global and national points of view.
? Disseminate the IG results within other relevant engineering organisations on a
global, European and national scale.
? Evaluate RDA outputs and recommendations and consider them with the focus
on engineering.
? Collaborate with those RDA groups that have affinity to the objectives mentioned
above, as well as with external organisations (such as AAES , CESAER , NIST ),
past and ongoing engineering projects ( Big Data Europe , BOOST 4.0 , DURAARK ),
and industrial stakeholders from different engineering disciplines like the
automotive, construction, energy or architectural sector.
We also expect that an IG will provide a stronger leverage when it comes to engaging the
industrial sector. Industry members are usually not present at university-based or
scientific-community-based workshops, but RDA provides a framework which is nowadays
widely recognized.
Participation
This IG will be open to all RDA members from all countries and scientific disciplines.
Particularly, but not exclusively, the IG will welcome members from the following
backgrounds:
? Scientists involved in contracted research, to share their experience in dealing with
RDM questions and non-disclosure agreements
? Industrial representatives from major and minor companies representing engineering
science and the industry (particularly industry 4.0) sector
? Practitioners of software engineering for the industry sector
? Policy-makers for non-disclosure agreements & legal experts
? Data Stewards and related research data experts
3
Research Data Alliance Charter, May 2019
? HPC and distributed computing experts
Outcomes
Major/Preliminary outcomes of the IG RDM4Eng will include the following:
? Identify, collect, evaluate and compare industrial and institutional workflows, services,
tools and best practices to establish an exchange & information knowledge base
for engineering disciplines.
? Develop a best data management practices guide for engineering researchers
based based on the results drawn from the experiences of the use cases.
? Develop models for dynamic consent that protects industrial and institutional
interest while enabling data sharing Ô as open as possible, as closed as necessary Õ.
? Define and evaluate existing and developing engineering data platforms or
repositories.
? Map RDM specific workflows, tools and topics e.g., a first approach of a
mechanical engineer-specific DMP template is given by RWTH Aachen University
and Technical University of Darmstadt; another metadata scheme EngMeta for
engineering science is developed by the University of Stuttgart.
Mechanism
Outputs and recommendations will be produced based on consensus of the participating
RDA group members. All topics will be openly discussed via the RDA communication
platform providing a CMS, document store, and Wiki.
At the RDA plenaries the IG will organize group sessions and will interact with other RDA
groups, e.g. by the organization of joint sessions. In between plenaries regular virtual
conferences will guarantee the continuity of activities and encourage the continuous
exchange of information. A summary of the virtual meetings will be provided for all initial and
group members on the IG website. Initial and group members will be invited via mail to all
face-to-face and virtual meetings and afterwards to the summary. As a first and ongoing
step, the initial members are to be used as ambassadors to invite known engineers to
participate in the IG RDM4Eng and to look for solutions in an international context.
In order to draw the attention of engineers to RDA and, in particular to the IG RDM4Eng,
we will actively participate at engineer-specific conferences and seminars like the annual
VDI international conference or the WESC by organizing RDM workshops, presentation,
posters and/ or bringing information material. The first positive experiences were collected
using this approach in the context of the german national research data infrastructure. At the
WGP (Wissenschaftliche Gesellschaft fŸr Produktionstechnik) annual conference 2018, a
poster and information material were used to draw attention to the initiative of NFDI4Ing .
This method is also useful to present the use cases and to show best practices. The goal is
to reach engineer in their familiar environment which lowers the barrier to formulate their
wishes and suggestions about RDM. In our view, it would be a fruitful combination for a use
case if engineers from academia and industry as well as an infrastructure partner take care
of the continuation of a use case. We see engineers are multipliers for industry partners.
Another mechanism to invite new members to join the IG is through workshops and
meetings organized by the national RDA nodes, e.g. the next Danish RDA node meeting .
4
Research Data Alliance Charter, May 2019
We will invite the participating engineers and infrastructure partner to take part in the
RDA-EU ambassador program. The initial co-chairs will accompany the groupÕs creation and
establish the activities. It is intended to conduct a co-chair election every two to three years.
The proposed IG has identified overlap with regard to contents with the following RDA
groups:
? IG Active Data Management Plans
? IG Chemistry Research Data
? IG Preservation Tools, Techniques and Policies
? Disciplinary Collaboration Framework IG
? WG International Materials Resource Registries
? WG Metadata Standards Catalog
? Preserving Scientific Annotation WG
? IG RDA/CODATA Legal Interoperability
? IG RDA/CODATA Materials Data, Infrastructure & Interoperability
? IG RDA/NISO Privacy Implications of Research Data Sets
? WG Research Data Collections
? IG Software Source Code
? IG Vocabulary Services
While especially the IG RDA/CODATA Materials Data, Infrastructure & Interoperability as
well as the IG RDA/NISO Privacy Implications of Research Data Sets have conceptual
similarities with the IG RDM4Eng, to our knowledge, none of the above IG focus on an
inclusion of both, industrial and scientific stakeholders from the engineering sector and
bringing them together both on an European and on an international scale. Co-chairs and/or
active participants from IGs and WGs that address a common topic to the IG RDM4Eng will
be invited as guests for a lecture and discussion during a session, or a joint meeting will be

"RDA/CODATA Materials Data, Infrastructure & Interoperability IG",https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rdacodata-materials-data-infrastructure-interoperability-ig.html,no,"The development of advanced materials inherently rests on access to a distributed materials infrastructure and materials research data to fuel discovery and innovation.  RDA aims to accelerate and facilitate research data sharing and exchange. Similarly, CODATA works to strengthen international science for the benefit of society by promoting improved scientific and technical data management and use.  Given these complementary missions, this RDA IG and the CODATA TG will work together under the following statement in support of the exchange of material data.  

The success of the scientific endeavor rests on the foundation of free and open exchange of ideas and supporting data.   We believe this kind of exchange with computational and experimental materials data through shared online repositories, standardized formats and terminologies and open programming interfaces is essential to accelerating the discovery, design, and development of advanced materials.  Making this data widely and freely available, as a ""public good"", creates increased opportunities for conducting fundamental research while facilitating potential commercial development activity of data-based services, tools, and applications.  It therefore follows that it is in the scientific and economic interest of all countries to operate under this framework of free and open data exchange to the greatest extent possible, in such cases where it does not infringe on intellectual property  or national security."
Linguistics Data IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/linguistics-data-ig,yes,"Introduction
Data are fundamental to the field of linguistics. Examples drawn from natural languages provide a
foundation for claims about the nature of human language, and validation of these linguistic claims
relies crucially on these supporting data. Yet, while linguists have always relied on language data,
they have not always facilitated access to those data. Publications typically include only short
excerpts from data sets, and where citations are provided, the connections to the data sets are
usually only vaguely identified. At the same time, the field of linguistics has generally viewed the
value of data without accompanying analysis with some degree of skepticism, and thus linguists
have murky benchmarks for evaluating the creation, curation, and sharing of data sets in hiring,
tenure and promotion decisions.
This disconnect between linguistics publications and their supporting data results in much linguistic
research being unreproducible, either in principle or in practice. Without reproducibility, linguistic
claims cannot be readily validated or tested, rendering their scientific value moot. In order to
facilitate the development of reproducible research in linguistics, The Linguistics Data Interest
Group (LDIG) plans to develop the discipline-wide adoption of common standards for data citation
and attribution. In our parlance citation refers to the practice of identifying the source of linguistic
data, and attribution refers to mechanisms for assessing the intellectual and academic value of
data citations. The LDIG is for data at all linguistic levels (from individual sounds or words to video
recordings of conversations to experimental data) and data for all of the worldÕs languages, and
acknowledges that many of the worldÕs languages have high cultural value and are
underrepresented with regards to the amount of information that is available about them.
This interest group is aligned with the RDA mission to improve open sharing of data through
forming transparent discipline-specific data citation and attribution conventions to be adopted by
the international research community. This interest group will add value to the RDA community by
providing breadth to the current roster of RDA interest groups: linguistics is a discipline that
straddles social/behavioral sciences and the humanities, and thus we have a great deal to
contribute to the general RDA discussion on a multiplicity of data types. This group ties in with
other initiatives in transparent research methods in linguistics at all stages of the workflow,
including Open Access data archiving and publishing, reproducible methodologies and critical
consideration of data licensing. The LDIG seeks to support these initiatives while focusing on data
citation specifically. The LDIG provides an ongoing space for linguists to come together to improve
how we manage and cite our data, and how we train linguists in good practice.

Who this group is for?
The LDIG is for people who work with linguistic and language data. This work includes, but is not
limited to, the collection, management and analysis of linguistic data. We encourage participation
from academic and speaker communities.
Objectives and outcomes
Our overarching objective is to contribute to a positive culture of linguistic data management and
transparency in ways that are in keeping with what is happening in the larger digital data
management community. To do this we aim to be a group that is able to provide tangible tools (e.g.
guidelines, software) for improving the culture of data citation and attribution within linguistics. This
will also involve understanding the breadth of data types linguists work with, and current uses of
persistent identifiers. We outline three main objectives. For each objective we also suggest specific
outcomes, which would be the focus of shorter term timelines (e.g. Working Groups) :
? Development and adoption of common principles and guidelines for data citation and
attribution by professional organizations, such as the Linguistic Society of America and the
Societas Linguistica Europaea, academic publishers, and archives for linguistic and
language data. Principles and guidelines will follow the recommendations in the Joint
Declaration of Data Citation Principles.2
Potential WG topics i nclude:
? Development of a common stylesheet for citation of linguistic data
? Adoption of the style sheet by publishers, archives, organisations and individuals
? Integrating RIS with linguistic data services like the Open Language Archives
Community
? Education and outreach efforts to make linguists more aware of the principles of
reproducible research and the value of data creation methodology , curation, management,
sharing, citation and attribution. Practical training also helps.make proper data preparation
less burdensome for researchers, and normalises this work as an expectation of the
discipline. While much of this work will be practical training, outreach also needs to take into
account the complex and varying attitudes towards creation of open access data sets
across linguistics.
Potential WG topics include:
? Development of training modules
? Delivery of training at conferences and workshops
? Development of tools for the management of linguistic data
? Efforts to ensure greater attribution of linguistic data set preparation within the linguistics
profession.
Potential WG topics include:
2 https://www.force11.org/group/joint-declaration-data-citation-principles-final
2
? Framework for valuing the development of linguistic data sets in job appointments,
tenure and promotion applications and in research degrees and postdoctoral
research projects.
It will be up to the LDIG to decide if any of these specific outcomes would be best met by forming
short term working groups with specific timelines for the deliverables. Other outcomes may be
worked on within the LDIG on a more open timeline. Further goals include fostering greater
transparency in research methodology, and data access rights. We expect that other outcomes will
be developed as LDIG grows and responds to the changing research environment.
Mechanism
The co-chairs will hold a conference call every two months. The wider LDIG will convene quarterly
meetings. The timezone spread of LDIG members means that these meetings will be held
asynchronously in an editable document. The agenda will be posted with discussion points, and
will be open for comment for a week, before actions are decided upon and delegated. We will also
host face-to-face meetings at relevant linguistics conferences, such as Societas Linguistica
Europaea, Linguistic Society of America, the Australian Linguistics Society, and at the RDA
plenaries.
Interaction with groups in RDA
The following RDA groups have been identified as having interests that are relevant to LDIG, both
in terms of technical and ethical issues in linguistic data management:
? Data policy standardisation and implementation IG
? Data Versioning IG
? Reproducibility IG
? RDA/NISO Privacy Implications of Research Data Sets IG
? Ethics and Social Aspects of Data IG
? Metadata IG
? Data Citation WG
? BoF on Data Champion Communities
? RDA/WDS Publishing Data IG
While setting up the LDIG we will ask at least four of our members to nominate themselves to
participate in one of these other groups and be officially named as our cross-group co-ordinator.
This will facilitate cross-group relevance.
Linguists from particular subfields may find that particular interest groups are relevant to particular
issues in their area, for example corpus linguists may find that the Big Data IG addresses relevant
3
issues. We encourage LDIG participants to also engage with other interest groups and working
groups in the RDA.
Related projects and activities
There are also a number of organisations and groups outside the RDA that LDIG will engage with
directly as the objectives of the group are addressed.

Social Science Research Data IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/social-science-research-data-ig,yes,"Introduction
We are proposing a Social Sciences Research Data (SSRD) Interest Group under the auspices of the Research Data Alliance (RDA), to foster diverse professional exchange on issues particular to data originating from the social sciences.
Social Sciences Research Data cover many disciplines, appear in many data types, deal with multiple objects and levels, and are very distributed Ð coming from various sources. It could be described as a patchwork quilt, lacking a grand design or focus. On the other hand, it is a way to cover the whole spectrum, to be flexible in collecting data.
There is a huge potential reuse of SSRD Ð for researchers, but also for professionals outside universities, for companies, governments, and for citizens.
As a research data community, we are entering the implementation phase of the FAIR principles: we can see first results on Findability Ð with various catalogues coming available. But for Accessibility, it already complicates as many social data are too sensitive to share directly: access to social sciences research data is not dichotomous: open or closed but requires fine-tuning on making data accessible. For better Interoperability, we need alignment on controlled vocabularies and ontologies, as well as semantic techniques to relate data.
A barrier for Reuse is lack of clarity in data policies Ð and their implications for researchers: what are conditions and requirements for providing access, and for using the data. For Reuse, new users want information about the quality and provenance of the data: where do they come from, how were they collected and curated, etc.
Social Science Research Data Interest Group Focused Initiatives
This new SSRD interest group will begin by helping to coordinate communications across the various current RDA groups of interest to our disciplines and to provide a place for our members to share solutions and concerns with others in our fields. These groups include the FAIRSharing and others noted by Braukmann in the ÒRDA Overview for the Social SciencesÓ1. We will also seek input and coordinate with the external SSRD community leaders and organizations such as CESSDA, DDI Alliance, IASSIST, ICPSR, IFDO and WDS. We will be open and inclusive seeking to use this group to connect the various organizations working to promote SSRD data sharing.
We recognize that many of the data formats and methodological approaches our members leverage often intersect with the valuable fields of the Humanities. This
1 http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1401105
2
is especially the case in the digital humanities and in particular the empirically based digital humanists. While we do not currently plan to directly address the concerns and needs of this community, we also understand that we have much to learn from each other. One of the initial tasks we plan will be to reach out to more groups in this community to explore the need for joint working groups and projects we can build collaborations between the social sciences and humanities groups at RDA.
While the primary goal of this new interest group will certainly be a coordinating group, we also aim to produce new RDA Working Groups to help provide solutions to challenges in our SSRD domains. Given the complexity of SSRD, we feel that the initial focus of our interest group should be very focused on defining working groups of immediate need to our communities. One of the first tasks of this group will be to identify potential areas of interest for the creation of working groups. One such area of immediate potential that has gained traction around the world is the implementation of FAIR principles. Three potential areas that need investigation in order to achieve implementation of FAIR in the Social Science disciplines, and that will require engaging all stakeholders (funders, producers, service providers, users), are as follows:
¥ quality of data
what does ÒqualityÓ mean for our community? can we share best practices across our community and collaborate with other groups to increase data quality?
¥ data policy
how can we share or align Ð and wherever simplify Ð data policies and their implications for making data available and for using data.
¥ sensitive data
estimates are that over 40% of the data in our community is too sensitive to make them openly available without any restrictions or measures. How can we address the challenges of enabling Access to sensitive data in line with FAIR principles, in a way that also addresses privacy requirements?
While these three areas are potential areas to begin working with, they are also only representing the initial conversations for collaboration. Our approach will leverage continued engagement with the social science research community and then coordinate the efforts needed to address concerns brought forth by the community.
Our primary goal is to provide a forum at RDA for users of social science research data to exchange ideas and to help coordinate with other RDA groups to share those ideas as well as develop any required solutions.
Objectives
3
The initial objectives of the SSRD interest group will be to bring together major community members seeking to coordinate international social science research data sharing. As noted above several existing groups within RDA are discussing topics of interest to the SSRD disciplines but none focus specifically on the disciplines of social science with the key focus on data sharing. We will bring individuals and communities together to provide this forum and define future working groups to help solve the issues identified.
Participation
We want to include all stakeholders and reach as broad an audience as possible. We will initially begin working with existing RDA groups and further discussions between CESSDA, DDI Alliance and IFDO to start the conversations. But we will immediately begin contacting the many other groups ranging from IASSIST to ICPSR that will be valuable in providing input to this interest group. Below is an initial matrix of the groups we feel would have interest in our efforts.Landscape analysis on sensitive data

Data Discovery Paradigms IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/data-discovery-paradigms-ig,yes,"RDA Interest Group Charter

Name of Proposed Interest Group:  New Paradigms for Data Discovery

Introduction:

An emerging statement on research data is that it should be FAIR: ÒFindable, Accessible, Interpretable and ReusableÓ. To comply with the first of these criteria, being Findable, we need a data infrastructure that supports users in discovering research data regardless of its location or the manner in which it is stored, described and exposed. This is a significant and growing challenge, as the number of research data repositories, and the need for cross-disciplinary data discovery, increases. This interest group aims to explore common elements and shared issues that those who search for data, and who build systems that enable data search, share.

User scenarios or use cases the IG wishes to address:

    Data search engines are interested in developing components and practices to connect resources and results
    Data repositories are interested in improving and expanding search on their platforms
    Users are interested in better interfaces and fewer places to look for data
    Data creators are interested in a shared set of data metrics for all search engines
    Data search builders are interested in sharing knowledge and tools about ranking, relevance and content enrichment.  

Objectives:

The objectives are to provide a forum where representatives from across the spectrum of stakeholders and roles pertaining to data search can discuss issues related to improving data discovery. The goal is to identify concrete deliverables such as a registry of data search engines, common test datasets, usage metrics, and a collection of data search use cases and competency questions.

Related Activities:

    NASAÕs WG on Search Relevancy Ð focus is on improving search result relevance for EOSDIS data
    ESIPÕs Information Quality Cluster and NASAÕs WG on Data Quality are both addressing ways of capturing and conveying quality information
    W3CÕs Best Practices for Spatial Data on the Web aims to improve discoverability and accessibility of geodata

Other RDA IGs whose activities are of interest and who we will interact with:

    Metadata
    Registries
    Brokering
    PIDs
    Research data collections

Participation:

The Data Search Birds of a Feather session at RDA7 attracted 41 people, with additional people who could not come to Tokyo expressing interest. Some of the names appearing below come from this initial group, and we expect others will join when an announcement about the formation of the IG is made.

Outcomes:

A detailed set of deliverables is to be discussed when the IG meets, but can include those mentioned under use cases and objectives, above.

Mechanism:

We plan to meet via video conferencing at least monthly, initially, with ongoing discussions via email and biannually at the RDA Plenary meetings.

Timeline:

M0 Ð Hold kickoff meeting at RDA Plenary 8

M1 Ð Establish web presence and mailing list, hold initial virtual meeting, prioritize deliverables, distribute workload

M3 Ð Draft an initial set of use cases; form subgroups around use cases

M6 Ð Post use cases to workspace and announce on RDA email list

M8 Ð Subgroups report out on analysis of feedback on use cases (RDA #9)

M9 Ð Draft case statements for promising use cases

M12 Ð Finalize use cases, decide on next steps; presentation at RDA Plenary #10

User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address :
FAIR Digital Objects (FAIR DOs) describe a concept of virtual data objects that has been
developed and used by RDA in various Working and Interest Groups. FAIR DOs may represent
data, software or other research resources. They are uniquely identified by a Persistent
Identifier (PID) and described by metadata rich enough to enable them to be reliably found,
used and cited.
FAIR DOs are currently discussed world-wide, in many RDA groups, in the European Open
Science Cloud, as well as in other initiatives with the need to design and develop large
integrative research data infrastructures to facilitate findability, accessibility, interoperability
and reusability (FAIR).
History ÒIG Data FabricÓ
The IG Data Fabric was originally founded in 2013 with the scope to harmonize and to
orchestrate RDAÕs core components for a data infrastructure. Over the years one of the
groupÕs topics shifted more and more to the introduction and specification of FAIR Digital
Objects as an overarching concept building up research data infrastructures.
The name of the IG Data Fabric is puzzling, confuses potential new RDA members, and
promises a steep learning curve to the broad landscape of discussed topics . To address
these issues and to focus the objectives, the members of the IG Data Fabric are proposing
to change the name of the group to FAIR Digital Object Fabric.
This modified IG charter was discussed in the IG working meeting, September 23rd, and
was open for an internal IG Data Fabric review and commenting period from September
27 until October 11.
FAIR Digital Object Fabric page: 2
In RDA a communication and coordination platform aiming at
1. Creating international consensus about the specification of FAIR DOs,
2. Operation model (identifying processes) of FAIR DOs, and
3. Exchanging implementation details

To address the topic of FAIR Digital Objects in RDA, a BoF session ÒBoF - Creating an RDA
Interest Group on FAIR Digital ObjectsÓ
[https://www.rd-alliance.org/bof-session-creating-rda-interest-group-fair-digital-objects]
has been organized at Plenary 15. More than 40 participants discussed various scenarios of
integrating the topic into RDAÕs landscape prominently. As a consensus it has been proposed
to make use of the existing RDA IG Data Fabric and to focus the scope of the group.
Objectives:
The IG FAIR Digital Object Fabric will provide a communication and coordination platform
aiming at:
Furthermore, the group will
? Regularly present show cases demonstrating the usefulness and practical
implementation of FAIR DO principles
? Report and discuss implementation experiences and challenges
? Bridge with the work in the FAIR Digital Object Forum [https://fairdo.org/] and

Participation:
The IG invites all members and communities building research data infrastructures to bring in
their expertise, to advance, and to propagate the FAIR Digital Object concept. This includes
the expertise of a broad range of stakeholders, starting from data producers, infrastructure
developers, data stewards, up to policy makers and funders.
Furthermore, the group will bridge actively with the FAIR Digital Object Forum initiative. Many
of the initial members are already members of the ÒoldÓ IG Data Fabric as well active members
of the FAIR Digital Object Forum.
Outcomes:
The group works in a pragmatic manner and is focused on real-life implementations rather
than producing textual reports and specifications.

Software Source Code IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/software-source-code-ig,yes,"Introduction

This interest group will provide a forum to discuss issues on management, sharing, discovery, archival and provenance of software source code. The group will pay special attention to source code that generates research data and plays an important role in scientific publications. The Research Data Alliance (RDA) mission is to build the social and technical bridges that enable open sharing of data. Software (as source code and executables) and data are intrinsically linked, both to ensure continued creation, analysis and reuse of data and also to preserve the knowledge of the software development, relationships with other assets and the context in which it was created.

This IG adds value to the RDA community by channeling expertise in software development, sharing, management, versioning, reproducibility and preservation into RDA, and into the RDA groups which could benefit from this expertise.
 
User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address

Software source code plays a critical role in all fields of modern research, where source code is written and developed to address a variety of needs, like cleaning, processing and visualising data. Software source code is a necessary component for research reproducibility and reusability. Thus software source code should be properly curated in the same way as other research inputs and outputs such as research data and paper publication. Software source code developers and organisations that sponsor software development should also be properly credited and attributed. 
 
Objectives

This interest group focuses on software source code as a first class citizen in the landscape of scientific research, related to but distinct from research data. The groupÕs objective is to bring together entities and individuals with complementary expertise and different use cases in order to address the following:

    Develop a consistent metadata profile for discovery of software, source code, algorithms and other software artefacts
    Review existing metadata for describing source code if they are already in place, especially those metadata that link source code to data and research publication;
    Investigate if there is a need for additional specific metadata for software in order to make it citable, findable and accessible
    Review existing schemas for identifying software artefacts
    Identify and promote an identification schema specifically adapted to track software artefacts
    Collect and publish use cases of current examples and practices
    Develop guidelines for managing, describing and publishing software source code
    Liaison with other groups in RDA which express interest in issues specifically related to software source code

Participation

This group is open to all RDA members to participate. 
This group will interact with the  following relevant RDA IGs/WGs:

    Research data provenance IG&WG
    PID kernel information WG
    Reproducibility IG
    Metadata IG
    Preservation Tools, Techniques, and Policies IG
    Virtual Research Environment IG (VRE-IG)
    Data versioning IG
    Data Citation WG

And other IGs/WGs if they become relevant to this group.

The group will also liaison with outside expertise on software that will be beneficial for RDA, like WSSSPE, FORCE11 (the software citation work in particular), the Software Sustainability Institute, the Software Heritage initiative, journals that publish software, and relevant national and international initiatives.
 
Outcomes

Provide an extensive background for RDA members on software source code development, sharing, management, versioning, reproducibility and preservation in order to foster the emergence of shared standards across the research community on how to describe, identify, find and attribute software source code.
 
Mechanism

This group will coordinate activities and communicate through following means:

    Monthly teleconference to discuss specific issues
    Asynchronous collaboration through Google docs, RDA mailing list and wikis
    Inform other relevant RDA IG/WG of the groupÕs ongoing activities through RDA group mailing lists
    Hold face-to-face interactions within and across groups at RDA plenaries.      "
Skills and training curriculums to support FAIR research software IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/skills-and-training-curriculums-support-fair-research-software-ig,no,"FAIR research software skills and training curriculums need to be identified and incorporated into broader efforts to facilitate increased support and recognition for the qualified personnel needed to achieve open science. International efforts such as Horizon EuropeÕs Supporting an EOSC-ready digitally skilled workforce aim to develop new support material, curricula and learning pathways for researchers, data curators, and data stewards and new types of professionals.

 

The recent development of the FAIR for research software principles provides an opportunity for the training and research software communities to advance identification of FAIR research software skills and curriculums, building on both existing work on research software training for researchers and the growing body of FAIR data work in this area.

 

This group aims to highlight the importance of this work to ensure research software skills are included in ongoing work, to highlight current initiatives in research software training that can provide the basis for skills identification, and to learn from complementary efforts on FAIR data.  This will be based on discussions at a Birds of a Feather (BoF) session held during the RDA Plenary in November 2021."
Health Data Interest Group,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/health-data.html,yes,"Introduction (A brief articulation of what issues the IG will address, how this IG is aligned with the RDA mission, and how this IG would be a value-added contribution to the RDA community):

Here follows a Proposal for an Interest Group on ÒHealth DataÓ (HD-IG), as a long-term initiative in the framework of RDA. It follows a rather successful BoF Session during the 6th RDA Plenary Meeting in Paris, which was attended by over 35 researchers and professionals from diverse backgrounds, who discussed several relevant issues, expressed significant interest in forming the proposed Interest Group, and helped shape its focus as presented here. The Interest Group will fill a gap in the RDA subject map formed by its current WGs and IGs, as at the moment, there is no RDA group focusing on the intricacies of Health Data, especially as it relates to privacy and security issues in Healthcare. Establishment of this IG will also enrich the set of communities involved in and contributing to RDA, as there are several professions as well as research disciplines that revolve around Health Data.

This proposal to form the HD-IG is rooted in a long series of European, international, and national projects in the area of biomedical informatics, in which the proposers have been involved in the past decade. These include projects Health-e-Child (www.health-e-child.org), Sim-e-Child (www.sim-e-child.org), MD-Paedigree (www.md-paedigree.eu), p-medicine (www.p-medicine.eu), Cardioproof (www.cardioproof.eu), Avicenna (www.avicenna-isct.org) and others.
Different techniques of de-identification were adopted (pseudonymisation and anonymisation) and ad-hoc privacy guidelines were developed during these projects, not only to meet the requirements of the in-force legislation but also to face future challenges in the possible exploitation of the projects. The scientific and practitioner community developed during these projects is quite extensive and several members of them are expected to join HD-IG.

User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address (what triggered the desire for this IG in the first place):

Data-based Healthcare characterizes a fundamental shift in the way biomedical data are collected and processed, as well as how biomedical research is performed. The application of data techniques in Healthcare will allow us to capitalise on growing patient and health system data availability and generate healthcare innovation. However, to bring about this revolution in healthcare there are legal, technical and cultural/societal barriers that must be overcome.
The proposed ÒHealth DataÓ Interest Group (HD-IG) seeks to bring together stakeholders from all relevant sides and provide a forum for discussion on the specific issues that arise when using advanced data management and analytics techniques in a Healthcare setting, particularly (although not exclusively) focusing on the impact of privacy and security concerns.

Bottom-up (evidence-oriented) analysis, seeking to extract useful knowledge by mining the daily routine's streaming data, is of fundamental interest in model-guided personalized medicine. In this context, advanced techniques are applied aiming to identify latent factors (disease signatures) that can explain and predict variability in drug therapies and disease evolution, reveal similarities among patients stratifying patient groups and build patient specific simulation and prediction models. Such an approach goes beyond classical flat file data analysis, batch learning procedures, and simple data analysis techniques commonly focused only on a few variables of interest and a well specified dataset from a specific clinical trial.
On the contrary, Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) platforms in this area should be able to handle massive volumes of uncertain, streaming heterogeneous biomedical data, to curate, validate and analyze them in an incremental/on-line fashion from multiple points of view and under different assumptions, as well as to include or exclude dimensions, combine different modalities and incorporate existing knowledge and previous beliefs, all while preserving the privacy of the patients whose data is being analysed.
The still growing potential of modern data management and analysis is today fully acknowledged, but it may remain partly undeveloped or lead to undesirable outcomes or misuses of data if not carried in parallel with a deeper understanding of the regulatory and legal challenges it poses to patientsÕ privacy and data protection. At the same time, harming innovation and putting restrictions on research should be avoided. Indeed, as debates and proposals held in different countries show  (such as on a ÒMagna Charta for Big DataÓ)[1], thereÕs a societal need for a more adequate legislative framework for ethical leveraging of data applications, balancing the needs and rights of data providers and owners.

It must be remarked that privacy and regulatory issues related to the process of Òdata-intensive scientific discoveryÓ have become a metter of special attention for the EU, in particular after the approval of the General Data Protection Regulation, which determines an updated legal framework still needing to be attentively analysed, with the aim to strengthening individualsÕ trust and confidence in the digital environment and enhancing legal certainty.
The general debate on health data policies turns around three core themes: the need to ensure that citizensÕ data are adequately protected; the need for Open Access to data for research purposes; the need of allowing a Data Value industry to play a growing role also in Health. As a consequence, it is necessary to strike the appropriate balance between individual privacy concerns in the healthcare setting and research purposes and innovation, which can greatly benefit patients.

Given the lack of legal international harmonisation and the different national implementations of data protection, different approaches and protocols will be adopted (many of which in accordance to HIPAA, which still is, as yet, the largest de-identifying constraint expression). Comparing and discussing these approaches is a fundamental need for the improvement of data technology in Healthcare.
The HD-IG will provide its members with a forum to discuss and highlight the legal, technological, ethical and societal challenges to the adoption of advanced data management and analysis techniques in Healthcare, to exchange opinions and compare experiences, and form Working Groups to address these challenges.

Objectives (A specific set of focus areas for discussion, including use cases that pointed to the need for the IG in the first place.   Articulate how this group is different from other current activities inside or outside of RDA.):

 

The initial focus of the HD-IG includes the following areas:

    áPrivacy and Security in Health Data
        sharing best practice on pseudonymisation, anonymisation, differential privacy, homomorphic encryption and dedicated blockchain applications
        developing models for dynamic consent that protect patients while enabling research
        providing a forum for discussing, explaining and responding to data protection regulatory issues
    Data-based Healthcare for Personalised Medicine
        analytics applied to highly sensitive health data
        disease signatures identification and stratification of patient groups
        patient-specific simulation and prediction
        exploring the potential of health data usage in in silico drug development and clinical trials
    Health Data Organisations environment
        defining a list of organisations dealing with Health Data to cluster liaisons with
        disseminating HDIG results within other relevant Health Data organisations

Regarding other related WG/IG efforts in the area, the following points can be observed:
The discussions during the P6 BoF Session shifted its original focus from ÒBig Health DataÓ to simply ÒHealth DataÓ and intensified the already high importance of privacy and security aspects in the field. This proposal reflects the conclusions of those discussions and concentrates on a rich set of issues that are critical for Health Data and are not covered by any currently active RDA IGs.
Other related WP/IG were invited to participate at the P7 BoF, to give short presentations on their focus and to discuss possible overlapping areas to be aware of, but also possible ways of joining efforts and actions on common issues.
Besides the connections estabilshed in Paris at P6 BoF Session with the following groups: Active Data Management Plans, Big Data, ELIXIR Bridging Force, Ethics and Social Aspects of Data, Long tail of research data, RDA/CODATA Legal Interoperability, Structural Biology, in Tokyo, connections were established also with two newly proposed Working groups, Data Security and Trust Working Group  (WGDST) and RDA/NISO Privacy Implications of Research Data Sets WG. 
Furthermore, in the Tokyo BoF there were interventions made by GeoHealth, i.e. the geospatial dimension in health data and related analyses; Population data base - project HIVE, i.e. building a repository for the Gold coast region in Queensland starting from hospital data to link to citizen data; Human stress management and monitoring Ð MindFlow; Clinical data publication guidelines - Nature - Scientific Data.
This IG is the only one dealing mainly with the vertical of Health Data, while other groups dealing with privacy, security and trust are horizontal with potential use cases from several areas.
Nevertheless HD-IG will seek to pursue collaboration with those IGs that have affinity to aspects it will address, as well as with external organisations, such as VPH Institute (Virtual Phisiological Human), National Association of Health Data Organizations (NAHDO), PerMed (Personalised Medicine), HIMSS (Healthcare Information and Management System Society), IMI (Innovative Medicines Initiative).

Participation (Address which communities will be involved, what skills or knowledge should they have, and how will you engage these communities.  Also address how this group proposes to coordinate its activity with relevant related groups.):

HD-IG is open to all RDA members to participate. Particularly, but not exclusively, HD-IG welcomes individuals with the following expertise to actively participate in its activities:

á      Clinicians wanting to use data technology to improve practice

á      Biomedical researchers using data heavy analytical techniques

á      Healthcare Data Analytics with data mining, machine learning, physiological modelling and image processing expertise

á      HPC and distributed computing experts

á      Policy-makers for Healthcare

á      Health bioinformatics legal experts

á      Healthcare administrators and Health Maintenance Organisations

á      Pharmaceutical industry researchers and manufacturers

á      Medical equipment researchers and manufacturers

á      In silico modelling, testing and clinical trial experts

 

A quick survey during the P6 and P7 BoF Session identified participants with all but the last expertise in the above list, an indication of both the diversity of relevant stakeholders and the strength of current interest in the focus areas of HD-IG.
Nevertheless, the HD-IG will endeavour to reach out for a large number of worldwide participants, focusing especially on those moderately involved in biomedical issues.
In view of P8, an ad-hoc communication strategy will be put in place, to engage experts and people involved in other Health data projects or in the external organizations listed above.

Outcomes (Discuss what the IG intends to accomplish.  Include examples of WG topics or supporting IG-level outputs that might lead to WGs later on.):

Outcomes are expected in the areas identified as part of the Objectives, namely:

    Privacy and Security in Health Data
        Best practices on pseudonymisation, anonymisation, differential privacy, homomorphic encryption and dedicated blockchain applications
        Models for dynamic consent that protect patients while enabling research
        Recommendations and standards on data protection regulatory issues
    Data-based Healthcare for Personalised Medicine
        Analytics applied to highly sensitive health data
        Disease signatures identification and stratification of patient groups
        Patient-specific simulation and prediction
        Exploring the potential of health data usage in in silico drug development and clinical trials
    Health Data Organisations environment
        Identify a list of organisations dealing with Health Data to establish liaisons with
        Address HDIG statement to relevant organisations to invite them to join forces in further developing the IG.

Mechanism (Describe how often your group will meet and how will you maintain momentum between Plenaries.):

The HDIG will meet at the next Plenary (P8) in Denver, Colorado.
In P9 HDIG will organise joint meetings with the related WG/IGs, which will have shown interest for such a possibility in P8.
In between plenaries there will be at least one meeting every two months, via teleconference.

Timeline (Describe draft milestones and goals for the first 12 months):

We are looking forward to having the IG established before the 8th RDA Plenary Meeting, September 2016 in Denver, Colorado, so that we may extensively spread out the news inviting relevant experts to attend in view of having the first official meeting of the group then.
In P9 HDIG will have joint meetings with related WG/IGs, depending on the interest of other groups in collaborating/working together.
The first outcomes will be presented at the latest after 12 months, taking into account the chosen prioritarization among the different areas.

Data Versioning IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/data-versioning-ig,yes,"Introduction (A brief articulation of what issues the IG will address, how this IG is
aligned with the RDA mission, and how this IG would be a value-added contribution
to the RDA community):
The demand for reproducibility of research results and re-using data is growing,
therefore it will become increasingly important for a researcher to be able to cite the
exact version of the dataset that was used to underpin their research publication.
The capacity of computational hardware infrastructures have grown and this has
encouraged the development of concatenated seamless data sets where users can
use web services to select subsets based on spatial and time queries, or other data
attributes. Further, the growth in computer power has meant that higher-level data
products can be generated in really short time frames. This means that we need a
systematic way to refer to the exact version of a data set or data product that was
used to underpin the research findings or was used to generate higher-level data
products, including who developed and also funded it.
Versioning procedures and best practices are well established for scientific software
and can be used to enable reproducibility of scientific results. The codebase of very
large software projects does bear some semblance to large dynamic datasets. Are
these practices suitable for datasets or do we need different practices for data
versioning? The need for unambiguous references to specific datasets was
recognised by the RDA Working Group on Data Citation, whose final report
recognises the need for systematic data versioning practices.
This gap was discussed at a BoF meeting held at the RDA Plenary in September
2016 in Denver, resulting in the formation in 2017 of an RDA Interest Group on Data
Versioning. A review of the recommendations by this RDA Data Versioning IG
concluded that systematic data versioning practices were not available. In 2018 the
Working Group was formed and first met at P12 in Gaborone. Its focus was on
assessing current practices and compiled 39 use cases of data versioning across 33
organisations globally. In January 2020, the WG produced a white paper
documenting these use cases and recommended practices (Klump, et al, 2020a).
The WG delineated 6 high-level principles, which provided a high-level framework for
guiding the consistent practice of data versioning and can also serve as guidance for
data centres or data providers when setting up their own data revision and version
protocols and procedures (Klump, et al, 2020b & 2021). To further the adoption of
the outcomes, the proposed new interest group plans to contribute the use cases
and recommended data versioning practices to other groups in RDA, W3C, and
other emerging activities in this field.
User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address (what triggered the
desire for this IG in the first place):
A lack of accepted data versioning practices has been recognised in different fields
where reproducibility of research is a concern, e.g. data citation, virtual research
environments as well as identity and provenance to enabling giving credit to all
individual contributors, This problem was addressed in the precursor to this new
group, the RDA Data Versioning WG. The WG produced a consultative white paper
that developed a framework for data versioning based around 6 principles (Revision,
Release, Granularity, Manifestation, Provenance and Citation). This work was
subsequently published in the Data Science Journal in March 20211.
However, the previous work by the WG only delineated the six data versioning
principles. Feedback from the community is now asking for actionable guidelines and
recommendations to assist people in applying the principles.
At the same time, questions are increasingly being raised relating to the identity,
authority and ethics of re-publishing, mirroring and re-using data. Many of these
questions relate to uncertainty surrounding identification and attribution of the data
that has been re-published or mirrored, in particular when a re-publishing or
mirroring process involves revision of data or metadata. Hence there is an
opportunity within the new IG to show how the principles and recommendations on
versioning can be applied to help resolve questions of attribution, authority, and
ethics arising from data re-publication, mirroring and re-using.
Objectives (A specific set of focus areas for discussion, including use cases that
pointed to the need for the IG in the first place. Articulate how this group is different
from other current activities inside or outside of RDA.):
The objective of the RDA Data Versioning IG is:
1. Promote the adoption of the data versioning principles;
2. Develop a set of recommendations for applying the principles; and
3. Analyze how these principles and recommendations can be applied to
questions of attribution, authority, and ethics arising from data publication,
sharing and re-using.
The RDA Data Versioning IG builds on the RDA Data Versioning WG, which has
established a distinct field of work not covered by other RDA groups, yet seeking
synergies with existing groups.

More than Revisions: A Conceptual Framework and Proposed Principles. Data Science Journal,
20(1), p.12. DOI: http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2021-012
Participation (Address which communities will be involved, what skills or knowledge
should they have, and how will you engage these communities. Also address how
this group proposes to coordinate its activity with relevant related groups.):
The IG plans to engage with the broad data community to seek the adoption of the
data versioning principles, and work with the community to develop a common
understanding of data versioning and standard practices. We have identified the
following RDA groups to collaborate:
? Data Citation WG to include its outputs into the collection of use cases,
? Data Foundations and Terminology IG to contribute and adopt data
terminology/vocabulary
? Data Granularity WG to align up versioning and granularity level for varied
usage contexts
? Sharing Rewards and Credit (SHARC) IG to contribute use cases to the
SHARC IG and seek their expertise on credit and ethics of re-publishing.
? Software Source Code IG to align data versioning concepts
? We will continue to identify and seek collaboration with other RDA IG or WG
that may have a focus on any of the data versioning principles. For example,
one of the data versioning principles is to record and communicate data
provenance information. We notice that the Research Data Provenance IG
has been withdrawn. However, there was a BoF session at the RDA Plenary
17 with the topic Aligning Provenance Approaches Across Domains. We will
seek collaboration with this group as well should this be taken off as an
IG/WG.
Outside of RDA, this IG will seek collaboration with communities such as the ESIP
Research Object Citation Cluster and the W3C.
Outcomes (Discuss what the IG intends to accomplish. Include examples of WG
topics or supporting IG-level outputs that might lead to WGs later on.):
The IG has three specific goals:
1) to promote the data versioning principles;
2) to develop recommendations for the adoption of the data versioning
principles; and
3) to provide a forum for discussing issues related to data versioning, data
re-publication, mirroring and re-using data.
Work on these topics may result in contributions to other RDA groups or starting a
new IG/WG where there is no overlap with existing RDA groups.
Mechanism (Describe how often your group will meet and how will you maintain
momentum between Plenaries.):
The IG plans to meet bi-monthly over a virtual conference tool, at a time to be
determined by members. The IG will also communicate asynchronously through the
RDA group mailing list and via shared online documents.
The group co-chairs may meet more often to discuss the group progress and
strategy to engage members."
Structure of Information,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/structure-information,no,"It is the objective of this group to i) discuss the nature of information ii) characterize the variant concepts in different fields and iii) evaluate to conequences for research data management.

In his classical paper More is different, P.W. Anderson (1972) discusses the hierarchical levels of nature. Each level is made of and obeys the laws of its constituents from one level below. All levels are connected by quantitative relations to their lower and higher hierarchical neighbor which links the physical entities of all hierarchies. In simple cases, when the constitutive relations are linear or conceptually readily apparent, we may deduce exact ab initio equations providing material properties as a function of its constituents. In most cases, however, we encounter the formation of complex systems with emergent properties. Typically, there is a branch of science for each level of complexity, since, for each complexity level, there seem to be objects for which it is appropriate and fitting to build up vocabulary for the respective levels of description leading to formation of disciplinary language. It is the central idea of causal emergence (Hoel 2017) that on each level defining a major discipline there is an optimal degree of coarse graining to define those objects in such a way that causality becomes maximal between them.

It is the nature of those objects which defnes the kind of information needed to describe them.

It has been argued that nature exists at a self-organized critical point to harness fluctuations in evolution (Gleiser et al. 2000). Intra and inter level coarse graining is thus reminiscent of renormalization group flow in interaction parameter space leading to universality classes characterized by the same fixpoint. Thus, we may perceive the world around us in progressively more structured entities.

For research data management, there are two major conclusions. First, since experimental data are created by dynamic processes classified by the symmetry of their respective universality class, one expects to find a finite set of spatio-temporal network structures considering all possible data. This is the theoretical foundation to strive for a minimally heterogeneous research data management by considering universality classes of data structures derived from system universality. Second, the discussion of structured information with appropriate measures of complexity opens up new avenues in semantic analysis, In fact, it seems possible to eliminate the qualitative by quantifying it with semantic metrics.

Key to measuring complexity is the amount and especially the kind of information [Floridi 2011, Ay et al. 2020, Klamut et al 2020, Jost 2020, Ellis 2020] different disciplines gather about their objects of study. In Statistical Physics, we find that the classical Shannon entropy measures system order which in equilibrium just equals the heat exchanged with the environment. In cell biology, we realize that each protein carries certain functional information.  Cognitive Science asserts how we perceive our environment and control behavior accordingly. Psychology is concerned with the assessment of our perceptions and ensuing actions. Finally, Philosophy builds logical constructs and formulates principles, in effect transforming facts into knowledge.

As a first step, we acquire chairs for the major disciplines physics - chemistry - biology - neurocience - cognitive science/psychology - social science - philosophy"

History

Due to confusion over the definitions/roles of WGs and IGs we have both a WG and an IG with essentially the same remit Ð metadata standards / directory of metadata schemas.

Proposal
The Metadata IG will concern itself with all aspects of metadata for research data.  In particular, it will attempt to coordinate the efforts of the WGs concerned with metadata to produce a coherent approach to metadata covering metadata modalities of description, restriction, navigation, provenance, preservation and the use of metadata for the purposes discovery, contextualisation, validation, analytical processing, simulation, visualisation and interoperation.  It will also liaise with the other WGs especially Data Foundation and Terminology, PIDs, Standardisation of data categories and codes and Data Citation.  This IG activity relates to data management policies and plans of research organisations and researchers, and to policies and standards of research funders and of research communities which may or may not be official standards.

The metadata IG will organise itself through online meetings and face-to-face meetings of members of the IG present at RDA Plenary events.  It is proposed that Ð while membership is open to any RDA registered member Ð key members will be the leaders of the WGs concerned with metadata.  

 

Metadata Principles - Created and endorsed by all the RDA metadata groups

    The only difference between metadata and data is the mode of use
    Metadata is not just for data, it is also for users, software services, computing resources
    Metadata is not just for description and discovery; it is also for contextualisation (relevance, quality, restrictions (rights, costs)) and for coupling users, software and computing resources to data (to provide a  VRE)
    Metadata must be machine-understandable as well as human-understandable for autonomicity (formalism)
    Management (meta)data is also relevant (research proposal, funding, project information, research outputs, outcomes, impactÉ)
After discussions, it is proposed that the Metadata IG is wide-ranging and long-standing and acts as an umbrella coordinating over the WGs concerned with metadata (Metadata Standards, Contextual Metadata, likely WGs on particular subject domains such as agriculture, marineÉ) which have time-limited task-focused.

Vocabulary Services IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/vocabulary-services-interest-group.html,yes,"The Vocabulary Service Interest Group (VSIG) seeks to develop community-based recommendations on approaches to publication of controlled vocabularies on the web. Community standard controlled vocabularies are used in metadata annotation and labelling data files to solve problems of ambiguity associated with data markup and also enabling records to be interpreted by computers. This opens up data sets to a whole world of possibilities for computer aided manipulation, distribution and long term reuse. The recommendations of the Vocabulary Service Interest Group will address the needs of research communities for using controlled vocabularies published on the web.  The Interest Group aims to represent all stakeholders involved in the controlled vocabulary lifecycle in research domains: content producers; maintainers; and consumers .  Discussions topics will include, but are not necessarily be limited to: vocabulary representation; reuse; curation; and interlinking or mapping. These discussions will allow the Interest Group to propose solutions allowing the cross-domain use of vocabularies, including mapping relationships between domains. This Interest Group will help to promote good practices by producers and consumers of controlled vocabularies.

Objectives
¥	VSIG will identify common terminology in the context of vocabulary publication
¥	VSIG will identify common functionality for vocabulary publication services
¥	VSIG will collect and report on use cases from the research community regarding using published vocabularies and vocabulary services

Sharing Rewards and Credit (SHARC) IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/sharing-rewards-and-credit-sharc-ig,yes,"Introduction 

(A brief articulation of what issues the IG will address, how this IG is aligned with the RDA mission, and how this IG would be a value-added contribution to the RDA community):

 

Data sharing statements and promotion is a strong reality but challenging, especially when considering the many obstacles that remain on several fronts. Among these obstacles is the lack of relevant and recognized rewarding mechanisms for the very specific efforts required to share organized datasets. 

 

The prerequisite for data sharing lies in implementing the FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) which can add to the workload if done by the researchers themselves; however this aspect is never accounted for when activity is evaluated by funders or reviewers.

In some cases, resources may come from different domains that were not necessarily initially developed for research (e.g. museum, clinical careÉ.). Data and physical resources sharing each comprise very different steps, methods and the involvement of diverse communities:

    Building of a research collection or resource infrastructure according to the FAIR principles (including all necessary steps for data and physical entities repositories)
    Elaboration of governance and sharing policies for the resource
    Development of tools to follow up on the use of the resource

Individuals with different expertise may contribute at each of these steps (laboratory technicians, resource managers, researchers, legal expertsÉ).

 

In 2014, the Expert Advisory Group on Data Access (EAGDA) carried out, through UK cohort studies, research into the governance of data access. The aim of their research was to identify the factors that help or hinder individual researchers in making their data (both published and unpublished) available to other researchers, and to examine the potential need for new types of incentives in order to enable data access and sharing. Among their findings:

    Research culture and environment are not perceived as providing sufficient support, nor adequate rewards for researchers who generate and share high-quality datasets.
    Making data accessible to others can carry a significant cost to researchers (both in terms of financial resource and the time it requires);
    There is typically very little, if any, formal recognition for data outputs in key assessment processes Ð including in funding decisions, academic promotion;
    Data managers have an increasingly vital role as members of research teams, but are often afforded a low status and few career progression opportunities;

Recommendations:

    At first, develop mechanisms that encourage and reward good practice, rather than on penalise researchers who fail to fulfil their planned approaches for sharing data (the carrot not the stick)
    It is vital therefore that funders and research leaders foster an active, on-going dialogue with international partners and work with them to build common incentive structures and effect cultural change.
    Recognise the contribution of those who generate and share high quality datasets, including as a formal criterion for assessing the track record and achievements of researchers during funding decisions.
    Form a partnership among funders, research institutions and other stakeholders to establish career paths for data managers.
    Ensure that the contributions of both early-career researchers and data managers are recognised and valued appropriately, and that the career development of both types of individuals is nurtured.
    Champion greater recognition of data outputs in the assessment processes to which they contribute.
    Strengthen career pathways for data managers; and recognise data outputs in performance reviews

(https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/establishing-incentives-and-changing-cultures-to-support-data-access-eagda-may14.pdf)

These recommendations have not been promoted so much out of UK whilst they are of great interest at the international level of research governance.

 

Existing initiatives recognise the value of certain steps of the chain towards sharing resources however gaps remain to be filled, especially as regards physical resources. As an example, the BRIF initiative (BRIF: Bioresource Research Impact factor/framework) has already tackled these issues for human biological samples and data. As a result, the CoBRA guideline has been produced and work performed on unique identifiers and relevant parameters towards specific metrics.

 

RDA IGs could build on those previous results and ideas to further identify such gaps and suggest practical solutions to promote resources provision to the community as a valuable genuine activity in research practices.

 

The workflow of the entire process, from resources production to their impact back on the producer has not been explored in RDA groups, to our knowledge. Furthermore, RDA community is focused mainly on data. Extending the work to resources that also have physical samples in addition to data would be a value-added contribution. As part of its mission in keeping within the goal of RDA, the IG will work at finding solutions to foster open sharing of resources. 

 
User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address

(what triggered the desire for this IG in the first place):

 

Use case n¡1 - The biomedical community: A growing portion of research relies on sample collections and databases. This is especially true in biological and medical sciences with the development of large scale biology in the Ðomics era. High throughput ÔomicsÕ platforms require biospecimens, and generate a great amount of data on large numbers of patients and/or healthy individuals. The size and complexity of the collections needed to promote translational research typically extends far beyond the scope of individual research projects and the need to produce these valuable data is being met by contemporary bioresource facilities. While sharing of such resources is essential for optimizing knowledge production, so far only a very small part of them are. A major obstacle lies in the fact that establishing a valuable bioresource requires considerable time and effort.  Finding ways to recognize and credit this upstream work is essential.

 

Use case 2 - The Industrial Ecology community: Industrial ecologists rely heavily on data to assess the environmental performances of product during their life cycle. This requires interdisciplinary data from several domains such: as chemistry, ecology, economy, toxicology and climate science, among others. Currently, the availability of harmonized datasets for environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of products is scarce and the existing proprietary databases are incomplete. Sharing research data on a Research Data Infrastructure is an additional, time-consuming effort for researchers that is not acknowledged. Reward mechanisms for sharing data would significantly improve the transparency of such productsÕ environmental assessments and the accuracy of environmental models. Moreover, it would also have a high informational value, facilitating responsible consumption and thus, increase the weight of the public opinionÕs pressure for significant environmental improvements of activities with high environmental impact.

 

Use case 3 - Data produced by marine and terrestrial biodiversity research projects that evaluate and monitor Good Environmental Status have a high potential of use by stakeholders involved in environmental management. The accessibility of data on the environment, especially in ecology, has never been more problematic, however. The cost of these data and their heritage value is increasingly highlighted, whereas due to budgetary constraints, the resources allocated to their production and their availability are limited. Rewarding data sharing could have a beneficial impact on the whole system. As a case in point, the data produced by biodiversity research are heterogeneous and produced by a multitude of entities, therefore standard formats and protocols would allow the interconnection of databases, and semantic approaches could contribute significantly to their interoperability. However, the specific scientific objectives and the logistics of project management and information gathering lead to a decentralised distribution of data, which can hinder environmental research. Moreover, data are considered as a technical end, and should be more intended as a scientific end, as an object of study: by furthering primary analyses, in the context of a research question for which they have been collected, data can be reused - within the limits allowed by their quality - and their exploration, by appropriate method as graphs, may lead to the formulation of new scientific hypotheses. Actually, the Òrising tide of dataÓ requires new approaches to data management and data preservation; access and sharing should be supported in a seamless way. According to the situational analysis of the French landscape of biodiversity research observatories[1], data planning, collection, quality assurance, description, conservation and analysis are mostly led by observatories, whereas data discovery (of potentially useful data) and data integration from varied sources are poorly done. This case study aims to present the latest trends in data infrastructure and data management solutions for research and to discuss the progress of the Open Science Cloud, tools and initiatives about data sharing rewarding in the field of biodiversity and environmental data.

 

A wide range of disciplines face the issue of no or little data sharing, including but not limited to the above mentioned use cases. They could be addressed within the SHARC IG along with its development and ongoing membership:

    Low-temperature physics: cryostats data
    Earth science: samples and data
    Materials science: catalysts, microscopy data, etc.
    Social science: raw data from surveys, interviews, focus groups or case studies
    Neuroscience: imaging data.

Objectives

(A specific set of focus areas for discussion, including use cases that pointed to the need for the IG in the first place.   Articulate how this group is different from other current activities inside or outside of RDA.):

 

The SHARC IG group will have four main objectives:

 

    To review the existing rewarding mechanisms in various communities, as well as their limits and identify factors that could to improve the process and optimize the sharing of bioresources; i.e. data and physical samples (ex: tools, incentives, requirementsÉ).
    To use this analysis to encourage the inclusion of bioresources sharing-related criteria in the research evaluation process at the European institutional level, (i.e. without making this activity mandatory, increase coherence between evaluation and real practice).
     To disseminate information and findings to diverse communities of stakeholders.
    To develop a process for stepwise adoption of principles and implementation measures adapted to national, local and institutional contexts. 

 
Participation

(Address which communities will be involved, what skills or knowledge should they have, and how will you engage these communities.  Also address how this group proposes to coordinate its activity with relevant related groups.):

 

Currently, seven different communities are represented in the group (details in the table at the end of document): Biology and Biomedicine (7 ppl.), Information Sciences and Technology (3 ppl.), Geospatial data (1 ppl.), Marine Biology (1 ppl.), Biodiversity (2 ppl.) , Industrial Ecology (1 ppl.), Bioethics (4 ppl.),

Anne Cambon-Thomsen is the initial leader.

Laurence Mabile will dedicate 30 % of her workload to the coordination of the group itself. Co-chairs will help in interacting with the relevant RDA groups and to coordinate meetings on their continent.

The different communities will contribute to the white paper detailing the existing and lacking rewarding mechanisms in the sharing process.

 

Three existing RDA groups have identified themselves during our BoF session at RDA P9, as having common concerns: the ÔResearch data provenance working groupÕ, the ÔRDA / TDWG Metadata Standards for attribution of physical and digital collections stewardshipÕ and the RDA/WDS Publishing Data Workflows WG.  Data Citation WG, Elixir Bridging Force IG, Reproducibility IG may have some overlapping interests, too.

Those groups will be contacted via the RDA platform, and virtual meetings will be organized to start with. If relevant, cross-sessions will be organized at RDA plenaries. We also plan to alert them about the events organized by our BoF/IG group.

 

 
Outcomes

(Discuss what the IG intends to accomplish.  Include examples of WG topics or supporting IG-level outputs that might lead to WGs later on.):

 

    White paper /position paper on ÔrewardingÕ mechanisms (existing and lacking) for sharing bioresources and their link to research institutional evaluation; To be published if possible as an RDA endorsed paper in an open access high visibility science journal with a science policy section

    Virtual web meetings will be organized as often as necessary, with a minimum of once a month for a regular update.
    Face to face meetings will be encouraged at each RDA plenary conference.
    Regular feedback will be relayed towards all interested RDA groups about relevant meetings and conferences of interest for group members."
IG for Surveying Open Data Practices,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/ig-surveying-open-data-practices,yes,"Introduction (A brief articulation of what issues the IG will address, how this IG is aligned with the RDA mission, and how this IG would be a value-added contribution to the RDA community):

 

The open data landscape is changing rapidly and we are only beginning to understand the impact of policies and changes in researchersÕ practice.  As open data policies are implemented and data sharing practices evolve, comprehensive benchmarking and tracking of open data practices can serve to illuminate advances in data sharing (where and by whom) and help to understand the reasons for different data sharing practices. Various survey reports have examined the gap between policy and daily research practices and how they might be bridged but the granularity and coverage of surveys needs addressing as open data practices vary widely between scientific disciplines and regions. In addition existing surveys differ widely by their questions and by respondent groups. The RDA community, inclusive of researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers would benefit from a coordinated, common open survey approach that could be adopted and implemented to track changes in practice and policy overtime.

 

Following a successful BoF session at the RDA 10th Plenary Meeting, we would like to initiate an Interest Group to 1. develop a community-designed modular and interoperable open survey(s) questionnaire(s); 2. determine how such open survey(s) can be implemented; and 3. Explore how the open survey(s) results could be analyzed globally.

 

 

User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address (what triggered the desire for this IG in the first place):

 

Several stakeholders would be interested to use a survey questionnaire made freely available to investigate the progress, evolution and developments in data sharing among their constituents. Such stakeholders include but are not limited to policy makers, researchers and their research institutions, funding bodies and companies. The potential use cases for such stakeholders are:

Use case 1: The G7 of Science Ministers have organized a working party for Open Science since 2016. The latest meeting communiquŽ in 2017 (Turin, Italy www.g7italy.it/sites/default/files/documents/G7%20Science%20Communiqu%C3%A9.pdf) stated the importance of research metrics and indicators for Open Science. This IG and the survey(s) that it will generate would contribute directly and indirectly to this call for action.

 

Use case 2: As a result of the publication of the report ÔOpen Data: a researcher perspectiveÕ, report partners CWTS and Elsevier were approached by the European Commission to inquire if the survey questionnaire used to perform the survey in their report could be used to run a survey among Horizon 2020 participants. Running the survey could have informed the European Commission on the practice of researchers funded through Horizon 2020, thus providing useful data to inform the European Commission both as a policy maker and a funder.

In 2017, the European Commission launched a call for tender for the development of the  next generation of their Open Science Monitor. This call specification included the requirement of running a survey on data sharing. The tender was won by a consortium including both CWTS and Elsevier which will lead in 2018 to a new revised version of the survey implemented for the report mentioned above. This first use case highlights the potential impact an open survey on data sharing could have for such players as the European Commission.

User case 3: The National Institute of Science and Technology Policy in Japan conducted ÒA Survey on Open Research Data and Open AccessÓ to investigate JapanÕs current status and challenges in Open Science. Authors conducted a survey of Japanese researchers at the Science and Technology Experts Network of NISTEP in Nov-Dec 2016. They were asked about their experience on sharing and using their article and data, their recognition of open research data, the sufficiency of resources, and the needs to support researchers. The response rate was very high (70.5%) and results were already used in a discussion on Open Science in the governmentÕs Cabinet Office.

User case 4: Publishers and related companies are conducting similar surveys. For example, Digital Science published their report ÒThe State of Open DataÓ with the results of a global survey of 2,000 researchers in 2016. This survey assessed the global landscape around open data and sharing practices. It  highlighted the extent of awareness around open data, the incentives around its use, and perspectives researchers have about making their own research data open. Such reports allow publishers and related companies activities to evaluate trends of data sharing in the research community to develop and offer best-fitted solutions. They also help researchers understand the potential of data sharing and enhances their practices.

User case 5: Science Granting Councils Initiative - The national research funding organizations involved in this peer-learning network (https://sgciafrica.org/en-za), which seeks to enhance the capacity of research planning and management capabilities, are interested in the potential of open data to support their research communities. The survey instrument proposed here would create an opportunity for this network to contribute to and benefit from its application. As research councils in this region formulate their strategies, comparable survey data would provide useful guidance to orient their policies and practices. Work in this direction would also provide an opportunity for SGCI members to contribute to a wider Global Research Council call for action on open data Ôto compare and learn from their emerging practices, and collaborate on training and outreach activities.Õ

 

 

Objectives (A specific set of focus areas for discussion, including use cases that pointed to the need for the IG in the first place.   Articulate how this group is different from other current activities inside or outside of RDA.):

 

Through this Interest Group, our objectives are three-fold:

    Develop the User Community:

    Participation and perspectives: to support application of proposed activities, initial efforts will focus on involving and understanding the perspectives of users who have commissioned and are interested in commissioning open data surveys. What did they seek to understand through their survey? What data proved useful and for what purpose?
    Promote dialogue among questionnaire designers and survey users

    Develop a community-designed modular and interoperable open survey(s):

    Horizon scanning: identify and analyze existing surveys to compare similarities and differences in topics addressed and indicators used; identify relevant stakeholders.
    Engagement & recruitment: engage with stakeholders (those who have commissioned and developed such surveys and other relevant ones identified in previous step) to raise awareness of this IG, assess their interest in collaborating, and identify skills and expertise available.
    Develop survey(s) and/or survey modules taking advantage of existing ones, available and willing expertise, focusing on communities with high interest and willingness to participate. Survey(s) could, for example, be developed in a step-wise approach developing specific pilots for specific communities, geographies, etc. (e.g. initial interest from funding bodies community could lead to a first Working Group).
    Address language and cultural differences to identify common grounds that can be applied globally.

    Determine how such open survey(s) could be implemented and results analyzed globally:

    Assess available existing technical tools to choose the solution(s) best fitted for our purpose.
    Identify multiplying networks to deploy survey(s) such as societies or associations that can help achieve a deep reach out effect to run survey(s).
    Run survey(s) using above tool(s) and networks.

    To avoid duplication of efforts, we will investigate opportunities to perform survey(s) analysis in a coordinated fashion to reduce costs by avoiding duplication.
    This coordinated approach also seeks to promote reliability in the analysis of surveys and comparability of findings, which should allow for better benchmarking.

 

 

Participation (Address which communities will be involved, what skills or knowledge should they have, and how will you engage these communities.  Also address how this group proposes to coordinate its activity with relevant related groups.):

 

We anticipate this IG will attract a broad-based audience. During the BoF session at the 10th RDA Plenary Meeting, we engaged scholars, research administrators, research funders, government representatives, publishers and research data service providers. Given the interest in the topic and the potential benefits flowing from comparable and harmonized survey data, we are confident this IG will be able to engage representatives from these sectors on an ongoing basis.

 

In order to be successful, this IG will need to count on skills and knowledge from experts who have experience in developing survey questionnaire development as well as in analysing and interpreting the results of these survey. Accordingly we will aim to engage and recruit in the IG the authors of existing surveys. Experts of research policies in local setting and specific disciplines will also be essential for the IG. This is why we plan to involve experts from various scientific communities.

We will engage stakeholders through our personal network and by direct interaction when names are available (e.g. authors of existing survey reports; list of 70+ participants to the BoF session we organized at the 10th Plenary in Montreal). The IG will also run an engagement exercise through RDA plenaries and side events, or additional events of relevance which will be identified (e.g. submitting abstract to SciDataCon-IDW 2018).

 

Coordination with other RDA groups will take two forms:

    Some IGs and WGs have activities that could have common interests with our IG as they deal policy, rewards, metrics, etc. which are key to development of data practices and policies. The two relevant IGs are Data policy standardization and implementation IG and Sharing rewards and credit IG. There might additionally be overlapping interests with the following groups: Data usage metrics WG, Exposing data management plans WG and Mapping the landscape IG.
    There are many RDA IGs that represent specific scientific communities that we will want to engage as they might have interest to explore data sharing practices through a survey for their own community. Example of scientific communities IG: Agricultural Data IG, Biodiversity Data Integration IG, Chemistry Research Data IG, Digital Practices in History and Ethnography IG, Linguistics Data IG, Health Data IG, etc.

Similarly there are non-scientific communities also represented as IGs that we will want to engage such as Early Career and Engagement IG.

We will contact and communicate with co-chairs of those IGs in the first months of the IG and meet those interested at the two RDA Plenaries in year 1.

 

 

Outcomes (Discuss what the IG intends to accomplish.  Include examples of WG topics or supporting IG-level outputs that might lead to WGs later on.):

 

The first outcome of the IG will be the development of community-designed modular and interoperable open survey(s) questionnaire(s). These questionnaires will be made open and freely available. We anticipate this contribution will promote the use of surveys by organizations who would like to better understand research data sharing practices and/or policy effects. Being open and freely available, will reduce barriers  that may prevent organizations that have the interest but  would otherwise not be able to perform such an undertaking for lack of expertise and/or resources.

 

The second outcome of the IG will be a consequence of the first as survey(s) will provide results to track changes in practice and policy overtime. These results will help articulate better policies, identify existing gaps, prioritize research funding, initiate projects and initiatives such as for example research infrastructure.

 

The third outcome is dependent on the success of the third objective described above (analyze survey(s) globally) which could achieve if fruitful an aggregated survey result analysis. This last outcome will help improve reliability in the analysis of surveys and comparability of findings. It would also allow for better benchmarking, leading to global or regional views on research data sharing but also global approaches to data sharing in specific communities (e.g. universities).

 

While each of these outcomes could be driven through dedicated Working Groups, it is more likely that WGs emerge for specific time-limited tasks. The first outcome might, for example, lead to pilots for the development of a survey module targeting a specific stakeholder community (e.g. funding bodies). The second outcome could lead to a WG looking into the policy dimensions of data sharing. And the third outcome might in itself become a WG to explore a centralized survey(s) analysis scheme.

Finally, this survey might become a good example of RDA-based survey in the context of Open Science and Data Sharing as community-based development involving various stakeholders, developing a de-facto standard to conduct global and comprehensive surveys.

 

 

Mechanism (Describe how often your group will meet and how will you maintain momentum between Plenaries.):

 

An IG ÔExecutive CommitteeÕ, composed of a limited group (max. 12-15), will meet virtually by video conference and/or phone on a monthly basis during the first year. The Executive Committee will focus its efforts on generating awareness, engagement, and recruitment of stakeholders into an IG community. The frequency of calls will be assessed for the following years depending on coordination needs and support generated by emerging sub-groups and WGs, who might lead on IG activities for limited periods of time. In addition to the IG co-chairs, the executive committee will take on board a representative from each sub-group and/or WG who will be the main contact point and who will report progress and decisions.

Sub-groups and/or Working Groups are indeed likely to emerge as the activities of the IG develop. Each will have a specific tasks and/or community focus. Their work will be self-organized but the co-chairs will create a structure to coordinate and support their contributions. Their interactions could take place virtually or physically (e.g. regionally localized group).

A calendar of events (e.g. conferences, workshops, etc.) will be created in order to collect and use opportunities for physical meetings beyond the RDA Plenaries.

 

More broadly, should the IG be approved and collaborations initiated to develop common survey instruments, we are aware that the issues of governance and infrastructure will need to be specifically addresses by the IG. Such support could be obtained for example through international organisations like the OECD who have an interest in developing policy indicators"
Federated Identity Management IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/federated-identity-management-ig,no,"A strategic element to maintaining a competitive advantage in research is by focussing energies in areas of innovation, which is facilitated by sharing of resources and support of inter-disciplinary collaborations at the national and international levels. The primary impediment to this resource sharing and collaboration is the lack of an effective FIM (Federated Identity Management) ecosystem.

The FIM interest group (FIMig) is an international cross-domain interest group to work on all issues related to the use FIM for the implementation of AAIs (Authentication and Authorization Infrastructures) in research infrastructures.

Not all research data and computing resources are publicly available so that access needs to be constricted sometimes, e.g. until a dissertation has been published, or because highly sensitive personal data are included. Thus AAI technologies should be a part of RDA activities.

Solving the problem of constraining access to services and data to authorized people is a fundamental problem in research infrastructures where solutions are usually seen as combinations of an authentication part (identifying the user) and an authorization part (determining a persons access rights).

Although there are many possible solutions to enable an AAI, the FIM approach is especially well suited for research infrastructures that are distributed over many sites and need to be scalable. User friendliness is an important issue: that the technology requires no specialized knowledge from the end users. Through the release and delivery by FIM of roles and other specific user attributes, FIM can also directly be used for access control of protected resources, although this is not a requirement.

The interest group considers as its main task to discuss and propose solutions for the problems that are experienced by research infrastructures that need FIM services in order to operate their facilities and to serve their user communities. This agrees with the RDA ideal of a bottom-up approach where the data-practioners, in this case organised in thematic research infrastructures, are the major driving force. Past experience has taught us that solutions are required on managerial, operational, legal and technological planes, which means that representation also of enabling organizations and software producers is needed.

The starting point of FIMig are the discussions by the FIM4R group (http://cds.cern.ch/record/1442597?ln=en) where a number of research communities have prepared a common AAI requirements document (http://cds.cern.ch/record/1442597/files/CERN-OPEN-2012-006.pdf) and initiated a number of pilot developments. This group is mainly EU based but the results and conclusions reached are not geographically restricted and valuable input has been received from colleagues in Asia and the USA. Creating a discussion platform within RDA will enable it to broaden the current discussions within FIM4R group using RDA contacts (thinking here especially of US and AUs colleagues) and of course the special RDA group discussion facilities.

Efforts will be made to ensure a balanced representation of existing organizations that are stakehoders in the FIM landscape. These are the academic identity federations and their inter- organizations, as are the research community organizations and the projects through which they work realizing research infrastructures.

Beyond Interest Groups, the RDA includes also Workgroups. These are much more focussed on solving specific use-cases by (reference-) implementations and need to have a well defined timeline for their realisation. The RDA FIMig envisages kickstarting such workgroups, operating under a FIMig umbrella to solve specific problems when it thinks this is feasible and useful. This is thought to be the most productive way of achieving progress and working towards the goal of providing an interoperable, production AAI service to the multi-domain research community and beyond."
Sensitive Data Interest Group,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/sensitive-data-interest-group,yes,"1. Introduction

 

Sensitive Data: A working definition of sensitive data is: Data is information, observations, measurements or some other form of documentation about a place, person, event, animal or phenomenon. It may be digital or non-digital. Sensitive data is Information that may be regulated by law due to possible risk for plants, animals, individuals and/or communities and for public and private organisations. Sensitive personal data as a specific subset of sensitive data include information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership and data concerning the health or sex life of an identifiable (or potentially identifiable) individual. All sensitive data are data that could potentially cause harm through their disclosure. For local and government authorities, sensitive data is related to security (political, diplomatic, military data, biohazard concerns, etc.), environmental risks (nuclear or other sensitive installations, for example) or environmental preservation (habitats, protected fauna or flora, in particular). Sensitive data may also be subject to stipulations of customary or communal law of First Nations Peoples, and may be subject to the guidance of communities, traditional leaders, and CARE authority. The sensitive data of a private body concerns particular strategic elements or elements likely to jeopardise its competitiveness.

A range of disciplines collect data which are potentially sensitive, presenting serious barriers to reuse and reproducibility. There are a number of barriers which need to be overcome before sensitive data can be utilised safely and to its full potential. One major challenge is that not all sensitive data is alike, with significant disciplinary variation in how sensitive data is defined, linked, managed, stored, and reused. Additionally, common approaches to working with, sharing and managing data are not always appropriate for sensitive data. For example, sensitive data exposes the different perspectives underlying the FAIR and CARE principles. Further, sensitive data requires careful stewarding such that it can be disseminated in an ethically and culturally appropriate way. Nonetheless, sensitive data has significant potential to be utilised in the conduct of novel and impactful work. Therefore, it is essential that a set of community standards and best practices be developed for sensitive data usage and management. 

 

Issues the IG will address

In addition to issues identified by the RDA community as this IG develops, we envisage this IG will address the following issues:

    Data carries with it different levels of sensitivity depending on its context (e.g., research discipline, who the data is about, what the data is being used for). However, it is not always clear how we should assess data for sensitivities in different contexts. A resource is needed for those working with data to allow them to make informed decisions about data sensitivity and, consequently, data governance, management, and usage. 

    Sensitive data is often de-identified. However, re-identification can be possible and can cause serious harm. Resources are needed on mechanisms of reidentification and the different risks for different types of sensitive data. Such resources could also consider how risk of re-identification may be minimised through the use of Òtrusted research environmentsÓ or Òsecure research environmentsÓ. 

    Data that has been labeled sensitive is often not shared beyond the team that collected/created this data. This is a challenge for reproducible research, and means that data collection is sometimes duplicated. More ethically and culturally safe sharing of sensitive data may also enhance the robustness of research design and development. Resources are needed which provide information for those working with sensitive data with information about how that data can be shared and reused in a safe and ethical manner. For instance, a better understanding of the kinds of Òsecure research environmentsÓ or Òtrusted research environmentsÓ used internationally may inform the implementation of sensitive data sharing practices. 

    At times there is a duality between sharing and reusing data in general, and for stewarding data in culturally and ethically appropriate ways (i.e., in general it is good to share data, but there are some cases where data sharing may have negative impacts). This duality is exacerbated in the context of sensitive data due to lower rates of data sharing, and increased potential for harm. Guidelines are needed for balancing principles of data sharing and reuse (e.g., FAIR) with ethically and culturally appropriate principles (e.g., CARE) specifically in the context of sensitive data. 

    Consent is a major consideration when sharing any data, especially sensitive data. However, informed consent can be challenging to obtain, especially when reusing data. This is sometimes a barrier to sharing sensitive data. Guidelines are needed that explore consent models, especially post-hoc consent, for governing the primary and secondary use of sensitive data. Such guidelines should consider the different criteria that must be met to obtain a waiver of consent across different regions. 

 

How this IG is aligned with the RDA mission

The RDA Vision: This IG aligns with the RDA vision because it will develop mechanisms for the responsible reuse of sensitive data - a data source that is both extremely valuable but which also carries many ethical and cultural considerations. Sensitive data will play an increasingly significant role in addressing the grand challenges of the 21st century, such as issues of social and environmental justice and equity, as demonstrated by the impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, the benefits and potential harms of sensitive data is increasingly being discussed in public fora as corporations and private companies leverage such data for profit. As mechanisms for sensitive data reuse become widely available (such as through the work of this IG), new innovation and invention will be fostered through the reuse of sensitive data. This IG has participants from University and non-University sectors, which strongly positions the IG to engage with all the variety of stakeholders. 

 

The RDA Mission: This IG aligns with the RDA mission as it develops guidelines for the technical components of working with sensitive data, and for addressing the social aspects of working with sensitive data including fostering discussion around the cultural and ethical considerations of data governance and reuse. This IG is well positioned to meet these challenges given the diverse backgrounds of the initial members. The connection between the technical aspects of working with sensitive data (such as secure virtual environments) and the ethical and cultural aspects (such as consent, disciplinary perspectives and norms, and CARE principles) is a key point of interest for this IG. 

 

How this IG would be a value-added contribution to the RDA community

Sensitive data is ubiquitous. However, its context varies. For this reason, this IG complements the work of a range of existing IGs and WGs, including: 

 

    COVID-19 Data Working Group

    Raising FAIRness in Health Data and Health Research Performing Organisations (HRPOs) Working Group

    Reproducible Health Data Services Working Group

    Biodiversity Data Integration Interest Group

    Education and Training on Handling of Research Data Interest Group

    Ethics and Social Aspects of Data Interest Group

    Health Data Interest Group

    International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group

    Social Dynamics of Data Interoperability Interest Group

    Social Sciences Interest Group

    Infectious Diseases Community of Practice (forthcoming)

 

The aims of the Sensitive Data IG is to provide a space to focus explicitly on sensitive data. While the scope is interdisciplinary, this IG focuses on sensitive data types. Our planned activities will complement the above IGs as we address sensitive data in domain specific terms (e.g., sensitive data in the health domains) as well as in general terms (e.g., systems for sharing sensitive data). The Sensitive Data IG already has members from a number of the above IGs, which will aid us in coordinating our activities with these groups. The Sensitive Data co-chairs are collectively members of over 20 RDA groups.

 

All members of the Sensitive Data IG are also active members of the RDA community. We will draw on this to ensure that our efforts take account of previous work in the RDA, and to ensure that our group remains up-to-date on RDA activities.

 

2. User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address
 

 

We identified the following key reasons for forming this IG. We envisage that additional use cases will be developed through working with the RDA community following endorsement. 

    There is a lack of guidelines for working with sensitive data both within and between disciplines/research areas. One reason for this is because sensitive data varies between contexts (e.g., between disciplines). To develop a cohesive but also targeted set of guidelines, a group is needed which comprises members of a range of disciplines with a shared interest in sensitive data. 

    There is a need for a framework which considers the ethical and cultural aspects of sensitive data, alongside the technical aspects. Individuals may want to share their sensitive data and may have conducted all the necessary ethical/cultural safeguards. However, they may lack an understanding of how this can be achieved with the technical resources available to them, what repository or sharing mechanism can handle such data, and how best to access persistent IDs which allow them to track the use of their data. Conversely, individuals may have the ideal technological solution for sharing without an understanding of the ethical/cultural considerations. A group is needed to facilitate a dialogue between the ethical/cultural and technical aspects of sensitive data sharing, and to produce tangible outputs which progress this discussion. 

    There is a general consensus that sensitive data is highly valuable but that it is not being utilised to its full potential. While there is a range of anecdotal support for this claim, a body of work is needed which explores and documents the state of sensitive data primary and secondary usage, and which examines the underlying causes of sensitive data reuse practices within and between disciplines.

    There is a recognition that there are a number of stakeholders with respect to sensitive data assets, and that each stakeholder has different requirements, needs, expectations, and terminology (e.g., in the case of health data, government, hospitals, researchers, community members). A group is needed which can synthesise the main expectations of different stakeholders to develop resources of individuals and organisations to use when engaging with, sharing, and accessing sensitive data (i.e., a resource for a shared language between stakeholders). 

    There is a need for adequate and specialised resourcing and infrastructure to manage, work with, and share sensitive data. Different data types require different solutions for management, analysis, and sharing. While a range of solutions are available for these different data types, their suitability for sensitive data is not always clear. Work is required to assess solutions for different sensitive data types specifically. 

    Our era is experiencing the most brutal collapse in biodiversity that the earth has known. Yet biodiversity produces many ecosystem services, and resources. However, species and habitat diversity is undermined by many human activities. The preservation of both fragile and overly coveted species and resources makes the publication of their geolocation sensitive. Other data concerning the characteristics of certain pathogens have also proven to be sensitive.

    The humanities and social science disciplines likewise require clear guidance regarding collection, use and reuse of sensitive data. This may encompass specific ethical considerations pertaining to data collection (e.g., balancing FAIR v CARE principles), research data collection methods when working with marginalised individuals or communities often on sensitive topics, the joining of disparate datasets, and considerations of how long such data should be retained, and where.

    For biological and geological specimens there is currently a global consultation on extending core specimen data with data derived from the specimen or linkable to the specimen. This raises concerns related to Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) and Digital Sequence Information (DSI) in particular for biological specimens, as it would make potentially sensitive data more findable. There seems to be two ways of dealing with sensitive data: obfuscating it to a level at which it is not sensitive anymore but still useful for certain cases, or limiting access to certain experts. Work is needed to develop our understanding of the effectiveness and implementation practices of these methods, especially the latter. 

    In a world of automation, it is likely that there are also automated services generating potentially sensitive data and for these systems a set of automated rules could be developed based on legislation to make a system aware that the data generated is sensitive and deal with it appropriately. For example, a service extracting label data from a biological specimen image (what species is it representing, where and when it has been collected and by whom), might not know whether the data extracted is sensitive.

    Over time, there may be changes in both the way that sensitive data is defined (e.g., a new data privacy law changes what is considered to be sensitive for a given jurisdiction), and what data is considered sensitive (e.g., a species is newly classified as threatened, or removed from a threatened species list). These historical categorisations of what constitutes sensitive data need to be documented so that records and repositories can be kept current.

 

3. Objectives
 

    Using the definition presented at the top of this document as a starting point, develop a shared understanding and refined definition of sensitive data. 

    Define various levels of ÒsensitivityÓ for data. 

    Data should be as open as possible and as closed as necessary. Within this context, develop an understanding of how sensitivity relates to openness.

    Identify different consent models.

    Identify types of sensitive data holdings and resources across various domains.

    Identify existing data definitions and standards for different types of sensitive data.

    Identify challenges in collecting, using and sharing sensitive data.

    Engage with key stakeholders working in the area of sensitive data management/analytics .

    Identify existing solutions for sensitive data collection, analysis, storage and dissemination.

    Identify differences in how sensitive data is managed between groups and regions.

    Document historical categorisations of what constitutes sensitive data and how these change over time

 

4. Participation 

 

Since the first IG meeting at RDA17, the Interest Group has grown its membership both in terms of disciplinary representation and international participation. 

Co-chairs: We currently have 10 co-chairs (7 from Australia, 1 from France, 2 from USA). 

Membership: We currently have 69 members signed up to our IG Page (https://www.rd-alliance.org/node/72299/members) from a variety of countries and disciplines. 

Attendees: Across RDA16 (Sensitive Data BoF), RDA17, and our first community meeting held in September, 2021, we have had 66 people add their name to the attendance sheet from 16+ countries (see figure below) (noting that not all attendees add their name to the attendance sheet, so attendance may be higher). This indicates that the IG is developing good international representation, although Australia still represents a significant proportion of IG members. 

 

Thirteen of those who had added their name to the attendance sheet had been to more than one IG event (e.g., had been to the RDA17 session and the community meeting) and represented 5 different countries (see figure below). 

 

Twenty-nine of those that added their name to the attendance sheet were signed up on our RDA IG page and represent 13 different countries (see figure below). 

 

This suggests that the IG is developing a regular community, in addition to the co-chairs, who are interested in this topic. 

 

While participants in this IG are currently mostly from Australia, we have been working to establish this group as part of a global Community of Practice. We are currently developing a strategy to achieve more diversity in international and disciplinary engagement. First, although we can get quite detailed information about attendance and country, we do not have similar information about disciplinary representation. This is something the IG will prioritise getting from members who attend events in the future so that we can track disciplinary representation. Second, the group has seen the recent addition of chairs from Europe and the USA. The Social Science Interest Group, which comprises a broad international membership base and chairs from Norway, USA and Australia, also has formal participation in the Sensitive Data interest group.

 

The next phase of this strategy will be through specific engagement with RDA groups and other stakeholders covering a range of domains and geographic regions. Specific stakeholders to be approached are still to be determined, but will be drawn from the these target groups which include:

    RDA Interest Groups: Social Science IG (established), International Indigenous Data Sovereignty IG (Initial approach made, pending response), Ethics and Social Aspects of Data IG, RDA-COVID19 WG (and the various sub-groups), Reproducible Health Data Services WG, Epidemiology common standard for surveillance data reporting WG, Domain Repositories IG, Health Data Interest Group, RDA/NISO Privacy Implications of Research Data Sets IG, Virtual Research Environment IG, Social Dynamics of Data Interoperability IG

    Communities outside of RDA: Relevant domain and discipline communities, e.g., the SSHOC and EOSC work programs around sensitive data, US and Canadian networks of Research Data Centres, International and Regional Statistical Agencies (WHO, UNStat, Eurostat, National Statistical Offices)

    Domain specific experts: we will identify domain-specific experts already within our community, and approach external experts, to either join the core group of the IG (as co-chair or as key members of the group) and/or invite them to lead IG initiatives (e.g., WGs) and events (e.g., facilitating workshops run by the IG). 

 

5. Outcomes

 

    To identify the key expectations of the community and use these to refine the IG's objectives. 

    List different types of data across disciplines such as health, social sciences, etc, and how different levels of sensitivities apply to those types of data.

    Identify best practices in sensitive data management across multiple regions, domains and disciplines and how to adapt the best practices.

    Engage with relevant RDA IGs, WGs and CoPs to identify priorities in the area of sensitive data management.

    Gather common guidelines and recommendations for working with sensitive data in different disciplines and in different regions, including different consent models.

    Develop a framework that brings together ethical/cultural aspects with technical concerns of sensitive data.

    Develop guidelines to aid in assessing the sensitivity of data. The aim of these guidelines is to both ensure that sensitive data are not misclassified as non sensitive (potential for harm) and that data sensitivities are not over estimated (resulting in data not being shared). This also includes examining how sensitive data cna be decoupled from its metadata and the implications of this for sensitive data assessment. 

    Develop guidelines on handling and sharing sensitive data across regions. Sensitive data sharing presents unique challenges to non-sensitive data, and this is especially the case across regions which may have different legislative and legal requirements.

    Develop frameworks for negotiating different stakeholder expectations when working with sensitive data, including those of communities, public sector, research institutions, and governments. 

 

 

 

6. Mechanism

 

The IG will meet every 3 to 4 weeks via Zoom. Meeting times will be alternated to accommodate as many time zones as possible. Google Docs will be used to develop shared documentation. Email will be used to communicate about meetings and tasks requiring follow-up between meetings. The current co chairs of the IG are already successfully using this system since December 2020 to meet and maintain momentum. More broadly, we have also successfully used this system for Community Meetings - we held our first Community Meeting in September 2021, with the second scheduled for October 2021. Community Meetings will be held slightly less frequently then co-chair meetings; we will aim for every 1 to 2 months depending on group activities. 

 

The IG more broadly will also meet regularly at Plenaries as an opportunity to workshop new ideas with the RDA community and to foster new engagements. The group will also establish an informal communication channel through Slack to allow for ongoing conversation (a slack channel has already been established here ÒRDA Sensitive Data IGÓ). The group will also organise webinars and information sessions between Plenaries to share ideas and for group members to stay in touch with the activities of the group. The IG will also use our RDA page to share documents and communicate regularly with the RDA community (the page is already regularly updated with IG activities, see here). 

 

For sharing of resources, the IG has also established a Zenodo community titled ÒRDA Sensitive Data Interest GroupÓ and a Zotero library called ÒRDA Sensitive Data igÓ.

 

7. Timeline

 

Initial activities: The group met for the first time as a Birds of a Feather session at RDA 16. Following this, a core group of interested members met to begin drafting the group charter. This group also presented a session and poster for an IG session for RDA 17. The group sent the draft charter for initial TAB review and community consultation in the lead up to RDA 17. Comments on the draft charter have been received and the current group of co-chairs and interested community members are preparing the revised charter for resubmission in October 2021. The IG had our first Community Meeting on September 22, 2021, and has our second Community Meeting planned for October 27, 2021. The IG has had a session and poster session accepted for RDA18. We aim to have the charter approved and the IG endorsed by the end of 2021. Representatives from the IG spoke at an eResearch Australasia Conference (12 October) on Making the Most of the Research Data Alliance (??https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/events/making-the-most-of-the-research-data-alliance/). 

We propose the following work-plan for the first 12 months following endorsement: 

 

    Formally launch the IG - update our RDA IG site, call for additional co-chairs, share the approved charter with group members, establish a regular meeting time (regular co-chair and community meetings have already been initiated), establish RDA mailing list for the IG. 

    Create resources (format to be determined by the community) aimed at developing a shared understanding of sensitive data through, for example, 

        surveying definitions and risks of sensitive data in different declipined and regions, 

        examining varying data sensitivities in areas such as military data, health data, biodiversity data and personal data,

        examining sensitive data in different regions (for example the discrepancies which exist in local / national / international contexts,

        examining different classifications of sensitive data including dual use of data and applications,

This work will be undertaken in the first 6-12 months and will be used to help guide other outputs and guidelines (these themes are already being addressed in the IGs session and poster presentation at RDA18).

    Engage in group consultation to identify the main themes of interest and develop a strategy for establishing working groups/task forces to address these. 

    Engage with stakeholders for feedback on key sensitive data issues and to develop the IGs networks within and outside of RDA. 

    Invite existing RDA IGs identified in section 4 above to provide feedback on, and participate in, working groups/task forces themes.

        In relation to points 3 - 5, we aim to focus on the outcomes and objectives listed in section 3 and 5 above. 

    Presentation of webinar/workshop to workshop working group/task force topics and open the working groups/task forces topics for group comment through interactive platforms like Google Docs.

    Formalise the working groups/task forces, share the goals of the working groups/task forces with the group and RDA more broadly to increase participation, prepare for RDA18 as an opportunity to share progress of the IG and working groups/task forces.

    Prepare reports and outputs from the working groups/task forces, share reports with the community, present a webinar/workshop to share the outputs with the community.

    Hold an IG meeting to assess the progress from the preceding 12 months and determine the next steps for working groups/task forces.

Original Charter, submitted in February 2021:

Name of Proposed Interest Group: Sensitive Data Interest Group

RDA site: https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/sensitive-data-interest-group

 

1. Introduction (A brief articulation of what issues the IG will address, how this IG is aligned with the RDA mission, and how this IG would be a value-added contribution to the RDA community)

 

Sensitive Data: A working definition of sensitive data is: Information that is regulated by law due to possible risk for plants, animals, individuals and/or communities and for public and private organisations. Sensitive personal data include information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership and data concerning the health or sex life of an individual. These data that could be identifiable and potentially cause harm through their disclosure. For local and government authorities, sensitive data is related to security (political, diplomatic, military data, biohazard concerns, etc.), environmental risks (nuclear or other sensitive installations, for example) or environmental preservation (habitats, protected fauna or flora, in particular). The sensitive data of a private body concerns in particular strategic elements or elements likely to jeopardise its competitiveness.
Adapted from: David et al., 2020, ÒTemplates for FAIRness evaluation criteria - RDA-SHARC IGÓ https://zenodo.org/record/3922069#.YCJU7ehKg2w

 

A range of disciplines collect data which are potentially sensitive, presenting serious barriers to reuse and reproducibility. There are a number of barriers which need to be overcome before sensitive data can be utilised safely and to its best advantage. One major challenge is that not all sensitive data is alike, with significant disciplinary variation in how sensitive data is defined, linked, managed, stored, and reused. Additionally, common approaches to working with, sharing and managing data are not always appropriate for sensitive data. For example, sensitive data exposes the different perspectives underlying the FAIR and CARE principles. Further, sensitive data requires careful stewarding such that it can be disseminated in an ethically and culturally appropriate way. Nonetheless, sensitive data has significant potential to be utilised in the conduct of novel and impactful work. Therefore, it is essential that a set of community standards and best practices be developed for sensitive data usage and management.

 

Issues the IG will address

In addition to issues identified by the RDA community as this IG develops, we envisage this IG will address the following issues:

    Data carries with it different levels of sensitivity depending on its context (e.g., research discipline, who the data is about, what the data is being used for). However, it is not always clear how we should assess data for sensitivities in different contexts. A resource is needed for those working with data to allow them to make informed decisions about data sensitivity and, consequently, data governance, management, and usage.
    Sensitive data is often identified. However, re-identification can be possible and can cause serious harm. Resources are needed on mechanisms of reidentification and the different risks for different types of sensitive data.
    Data that has been labeled sensitive is often not shared beyond the team that collected/created this data. This means that data collection is sometimes duplicated, and is a challenge for reproducible research. More ethically and culturally safe sharing of sensitive data may also enhance the robustness of research design and development. Resources are needed which provide information for those working with sensitive data with information about how that data can be shared and reused in a safe and ethical manner.
    At times there is a duality between sharing and reusing data in general, and for stewarding data in culturally and ethically appropriate ways. This duality is exacerbated in the context of sensitive data due to lower rates of data sharing, and increased potential for harm. Guidelines are needed for balancing principles of data sharing and reuse (e.g., FAIR) with ethically and culturally appropriate principles (e.g., CARE) specifically in the context of sensitive data.
    Consent is a major consideration when sharing any data, especially sensitive data. However, informed consent can be challenging to obtain, especially when reusing data. This is sometimes a barrier to sharing sensitive data. Guidelines are needed that explore consent models, especially post-hoc consent, for governing the primary and secondary use of sensitive data. 

 

How this IG is aligned with the RDA mission

The RDA Vision: This IG aligns with the RDA vision because it will develop mechanisms for the responsible reuse of sensitive data - a data source that is both extremely valuable but which also carries many ethical and cultural considerations. Sensitive data will play an increasingly significant role in addressing the grand challenges of the 21st century, such as issues of social and environmental justice. Indeed, the benefits and potential harms of sensitive data are increasingly being discussed in public forums as corporations and private companies leverage such data for profit. As mechanisms for sensitive data reuse become widely available (such as through the work of this IG), new innovation and invention will be fostered through the reuse of sensitive data. This IG has participants from University and non-University sectors, which strongly positions the IG to engage with all the variety of stakeholders.

 

The RDA Mission: This IG aligns with the RDA mission as it develops guidelines for the technical components of working with sensitive data, and for addressing the social aspects of working with sensitive data including fostering d"
RDA Privacy Implications of Research Data Sets IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rdaniso-privacy-implications-research-data-sets-wg.html,yes,"This Working Group will explore issues related to scientific research data sets that contain human subject information, as well as related datasets that have the potential to be combined in a way that can expose private information. Over a period of 18 months, the group will develop a framework for how researchers and repositories should appropriately manage human-subject datasets, to develop a metadata set to describe the privacy-related aspects of research datasets, compile a bibliography of related resources, and to build awareness of the privacy implications of research-data sharing. While privacy is related to the ethical, legal, and data-publishing issues surrounding data management of which privacy is a part, this working group is focused specifically on privacy-related concerns and will support, where appropriate, the related work of other RDA working groups.

 

Outcomes
The group will work to achieve the following specific outcomes:

    Development of a framework that explains, at a high level, the precautions that data creators, repositories, aggregators and scientists should use in creating, using, preserving, and providing access to research data.
    Definitions of key vectors where privacy issues are evident in the ecosystem of data sharing and reuse.
    An outline of situations where the privacy principles would be applied.
    Identification of key areas of variance in privacy laws or regulations at national and international levels that are significant when sharing data worldwide.
    Definition of a set of technical metadata that can be used to describe privacy-related information contained within a data set, parameters for use, and description of where it should be applied.
    Gather and share a bibliography of data-and-privacy-related materials for public use.
    Advancement of adoption of the principles through an outreach and communications campaign.

 

Value Proposition
 

Beneficiaries
The information that comes out of this project will enhance the privacy of people worldwide whose personal data become the subject of research, as well as offer guidelines those involved with the collection, preservation, sharing, use, and re-use of that data. The latter group is very broad, as the number of fields that are usingÑor could potentially benefit from applyingÑhuman subject research data is tremendous. Medicine and psychology are obvious examples, but data science is also being integrated into other fields such as the humanities and social sciences. Disciplines have developed ethics for researchers in these situations and human-subjects review protocols ensure proper treatment of research subjects during studies, but no generalized guidelines yet exist for these same privacy issues in the deposit, preservation, and re-use of such datasets. Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) vet a variety of research processes, including data management and reuse polices primarily within the United States, but even there a 2014 report by the National Academies recommended a number of changes to the IRB systemÑchanges that will be informed by the recommendations produced by this working group. Other parties that might benefit from this effort are research funding bodies, governments, and academic data repositories.

 

Benefits

1)  Improving the understanding of the privacy issues that relate specifically to research data from distinct stakeholder perspectives.

2)  Support of a worldwide dialogue about the privacy issues that surround the sharing, combination, and reuse of research data.

3)  Reduction of the risk of an unintentional release of personally identifiable information through the sharing or reuse of research data.

4)  The creation and adoption of this framework will reduce the potential risk to scientific discovery writ large that might be caused by the unintentional but significant exposure  of personal data.

Engagement with existing work in the area 

NISO and RDA are both involved in related work. Related efforts are also being undertaken by outside organizations, and this working group will in some cases include individuals involved in those endeavors. In other cases, the results of the outside work being undertaken will be studied and, where applicable, applied to this project.

 

The following are some related projects. 

 

NISO has completed a project funded by the Mellon Foundation related to privacy of patron data in library, publisher, and software-provider systems. This effort created a high-level set of principles that will provide the scholarly communications community with a benchmark to relate to these issues. The principles were distributed and discussed in late 2015. While that project was explicitly focused on the U.S. market and not focused on data, but rather on publisher and library end-user services, it is related to, and will inform, this work.

 

The Research Data Alliance has a number of groups that are exploring related issues as well. An interest group within the RDA is focused on Legal Interoperability for data sets. This group has been developing a core set of principles and guidelines that include best practices through which legal interoperability can be achieved. For human subject data, a core component of legal interoperability deals directly with privacy issues. 

 

A new RDA working group has formed that will explore security and trust as it relates to research data. The group, which has posted its case statement for comment, will be focused primarily on the technological aspects of security and trust building necessary for security of potentially injurious data, if released. Certainly, security is a component of protection of privacy and there are many examples of efforts to securely share information, although a significant portion of privacy-related issues are policy focused, not necessarily technology focused.

Yet another intersecting group within RDA is centered on the topic of Ethics and Social Aspects of Data (ESAD). This group is studying a broad set of issues surrounding data sharing and the culture of scientists. It is creating an annotated bibliography and plans to pursue two additional deliverables, producing educational materials and case studies of ethical dilemmas faced by researchers working with data. Privacy is among many concerns that the group is focused on, although many ethical issues extend well beyond privacy. Conversations between ESAD and this group have already begun and the efforts should be complimentary.

 

Several additional working groups have similar connections to privacy. As this project develops, liaisons and points of contact with other groups will be explored and fostered. One such effort is the work by the Data & Society Institute and its Council for Big Data, Ethics, and Society (BDES). Data & Society is Òa research institute in New York City that is focused on social, cultural, and ethical issues arising from data-centric technological development.Ó In 2015, the project produced a survey report entitled Human-Subjects Protections and Big Data: Open Questions and Changing Landscapes, which outlines some of the challenges related to scholarly data resources and privacy. In September of that year, BDES announced a new network to Òfacilitate information sharing, discussion, and community building among academics, practitioners, researchers, and others who seek to raise important questions, share opportunities, and ask for help navigating complex data ethics issues.Ó 

 

There is a significant project led by the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences entitled Privacy Tools for Sharing Research Data. This effort is part of a larger National Science Foundation Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace Project that has received additional support from the Sloan Foundation and Google, Inc. That projectÕs goals are Òto help enable the collection, analysis, and sharing of sensitive data while providing privacy for individual subjects.Ó A good deal of its work has been around tools to support differential privacy risk assessments as a framework for decision making about the risks and controls necessary to support privacy. The group has developed open course materials, hosted seminars, and produced a variety of papers and presentations. It has also organized a public symposium hosted by the Harvard Institute for Applied Computational Science Privacy in a Networked World, held Friday, January 23, 2015. The symposium included speakers Edward Snowden, Bruce Schneier, John DeLong, John Wilbanks, Lee Rainie, and Cynthia Dwork. This initiative is primarily, though not exclusively, focused on the technological and computational elements of privacy and data protection. NISO has worked closely with several members of this team and plans to include them in this working group.

 

 

Work Plan

The group will focus on world-wide legal frameworks and the impacts these frameworks have on data sharing, especially with human-subject data. After gathering these legal strictures and comparing the differences and similarities, the group will begin crafting a set of principles that will provide guidance to the researcher and repository communities on how to manage these data when they are received. Building on these, the group will craft a set of use cases on how the principles will be applied. After these elements are completed, an effort to advance the principles through promotion and community outreach will be developed and executed.                   

 

Participation
This working group will be open to all RDA and NISO members.

Mechanisms and Coordination
The group will meet face-to-face during the RDA Plenaries to craft its work plan, build interest and awareness, and to share its work with other working and interest groups regarding privacy and data sharing.

The group will meet virtually twice per month during the interim periods between plenaries. This will be undertaken using NISOÕs virtual meeting service as well as using the RDAÕs supporting services, such as the RDA website and wiki.

Meetings and group communications will be coordinated by NISO staff and the other co-chairs.

NISO is planning to host a public symposium on research data and privacy, in coordination with the RDA P8 in Denver, CO in the fall of 2016.

All documents related to this project will be publicly available on both the RDA website and mirrored on the NISO website.

A timeline for the project is included within the full Case Statement."
Small Unmanned Aircraft SystemsÕ Data IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/small-unmanned-aircraft-systems%E2%80%99-data-ig,yes,"Introduction

?????Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) are rapidly becoming important tools for data capture across many Scientific domains, as well as within commercial industry.  sUAS have the potential to transform how data are captured in many arenas by, offering higher temporal and spatial resolutions, with less impact on the environments being monitored, and access to new locations and parameters.  In many cases these advantages are further accompanied by lowered costs and increased human safety during data capture.   

 

As a new technology, however, there are currently no industry-wide accepted best practices for sUAS sensor and flight data handling and management.  There are many reasons for why such would be beneficial but 3 of particular note include:

(1) The creation of standards would lower the barrier to entry and  innovation in terms of what might be monitored with sUAS, by reducing the number of unknowns a new user faces and providing working examples to serve as guides.

(2) With no common goal standards to build to, the development of mature tools for sUAS captured data processing and fusion (with sUAS and other data sources) is currently hampered.  As a consequence, each use case generally develops a unique custom pipeline that only sees one-time use. 

(3) sUAS captured data is - for the most part - not being managed according to data stewardship best practices, such as would ensure the data is FAIR, as articulated by Force11 (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable).  

 

This interest group therefore seeks to explore and publish (via the RDA community based working group model), some best practices as regards the handling of sUAS captured sensor and flight data.  By publishing such, after a broad, cross-community engagement process, it is hoped and expected that such will see adoption by both those already using sUAS for scientific work those just beginning to explore their possibilities.  They will therefore address the 3 concerns laid out above, with the associated positive consequences for the scientific community. These outcomes also align directly with the RDAÕs Vision and Mission focus, namely, promoting the open sharing of data.

 

User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address

There are many examples to list here, the following 3 specific examples are selected solely for the broader context they represent:

(1) It is possible to place a temperature sensor on a sUAS. However, there is currently no other equivalent (spatially or temporally) example of capturing temperature data.  It is therefore left to each individual researcher to; create a sampling protocol, to select a data storage format, to determine which of the many possible metadata parameters are worth storing, to develop a tool for processing the captured data for integration with other data sets, and finally to choose how to publish the captured data and with what metadata.

(2) It is currently a non-trivial task (generally one that requires at least team including of members with electrical, computational, and mechanical engineering expertise, along with the target science expertise) to go about using a sUAS to capture data in the field.  As a result, there is a new industry evolving that is able to provide many of the desired data products to a researcher for a fee.  If standard practices existed these providers would firstly be able to utilise them where advantageous to their own models. Secondly, researchers would be able to require the commercial providers adhere to such, so as to ensure good open data stewardship practices are upheld.

(3) As indicated above it is is currently a non-trivial task to use a sUAS based sensory system.  However, in addition to the industry avenue - thanks to the long standing hobbyist Remote Control market - there is already a highly sophisticated and very mature fully open sUAS stack, that is also available to researchers.  While already mature in fundamental function this stack is immature in terms of usability and science use case features.  It therefore still requires many of the above mentioned expertise to be successfully utilised.  However, many of these remaining challenges could be removed or overcome, if the appropriate common standards were in place for developers to build to. 

 

Objectives:

    Provide a venue for data standards and recommendations comparisons with oceanographic AUVs, and other similar platforms.
    Identify common and divergent data needs across sUAS implementations in different domains.
    Identify a community aggregation point for others in the field who are currently isolated.
    Identify community partnerships, including with industry, tech companies/manufacturers, and computing organizations and infrastructures.
    Provide a venue for ongoing community discussion around the legalities, logistics and opportunities governing sUAS use, given that sUAS are a relatively new data collection platform.

 

Participation:

Within RDA:

Agricultural Data IG, Geospatial IG, Metadata IG, Marine Data Harmonization, Vocabulary Services IG, Weather Climate and Air Quality IG

 

External to RDA:

Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP): This group will be closely linked with the Earth Science Informatics community through joint development (and continued) collaboration with the Federation of Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP). The Drone Cluster (chaired by Lindsay Barbieri and Jane Wyngaard) provides ample opportunity to work closely with Earth Science data practitioners from NASA, NOAA, USGS, USDA and other major sUAS research organizations. Sessions at biannual meetings and monthly telecons have set the stage for collaborative work and can continue to attract sUAS user interest both from the researcher and data practitioner perspective. Additionally, previous collaborations between the ESIP Drone Cluster and the ESIP Education Workgroup have already resulted in sUAS-use education for K-12 teachers and further workshops for education and implementation activities could be developed.

 

The following is a list of groups whom Wyngaard and Barbieri have been in contact with, with interest in helping to develop further data and metadata standards and community working relationships:

    AgGateway: Consortium of over 300 agricultural industry partners (including sUAS companies) for the development of agricultural industry standards. Barbieri has attended their annual meeting, presented during their geospatial working group session, and has garnered interest and support from their UAS precision agriculture community.
    UAViators, Humanitarian UAV Network: With over 2,500 members in 80+ countries they promote the safe, coordinated and effective use of UAVs for data collection and cargo delivery in a wide range of humanitarian and development settings by developing and championing international guidelines for the responsible use of UAVs. Barbieri has connected with Patrick Meier (director), and had him speak at an ESIP meeting and garnered interest for the continued discussion and community development of UAS data standards.
    The American Geophysical Union (AGU): Members of the AGU are currently discussing formalizing a UAS Focus Group, or more formalized UAS in Earth Sciences working group. Barbieri has been in communication with them and garnered interest and support for collaboration between AGU Focus Group and an RDA IG.

 

Other organizations we intend to reach out to, with whom weÕve had some communication and collaborative ties, but no direct explicit RDA IG communication yet:

    OGC, DOT, USGS, W3C, CTEMPS, ASPRS, NOAA

 

 

Outcomes (Discuss what the IG intends to accomplish.  Include examples of WG topics or supporting IG-level outputs that might lead to WGs later on.):

    Provide a discussion venue for sUAS use within many disciplines to distill current data and metadata uses and needs - with a final report on current practices and identify gaps.
    Provide a list of recommended data formats for a relevant range of parameters.
    Provide a list of recommended metadata formats for a range of relevant parameters.
    Provide a recommended parameter naming convention to be used.
    Provide a recommended file naming convention to be used.
    Provide an international and transdisciplinary community platform for continued discussion, development, and implementation of sUAS data recommendations.

?????

 

Mechanism (Describe how often your group will meet and how will you maintain momentum between Plenaries.):

    Regular telecons,potentially subdivided into relevant sections, and as frequent as it relevant for each.For instance, initially there may need to be a weekly telecon for those interested in the broad goal and contributing new insights.This might fade to a monthly telecon.Simultaneously, there may need to be a weekly telecon for those interested in and focused on organising the first kickoff session.Post P9 this may convert into a weekly telecon focused on spinning off a working group.
    Within the USA, the ESIP drone cluster will support bi-annual meetings at meetings in January and July annually.It is hoped that similar equivalent local meetings will develop in Europe and elsewhere.
    The Interest group may potentially support the submission of proposals where the goals of such align with those of this Interest Group.
    Active documentation of IG activity through use of the Open Science Framework, RDA website, or other web-based project management tool, and possible ongoing collaboration through Slack or other online host.

 

Timeline (Describe draft milestones and goals for the first 12 months):

    Hold a kick-off session at P9 in April 2017 that sees contributions from as many relevant sectors as possible (sUAS manufacture and data collection-processing industry, various academic and non-academic current sUAS users, data practice experts, RC hobbiest sUAS community members, and experts from relevant analogous fields).
    Post P9, host continued community discussions to develop a 3 year strategic plan for the sUAS RDA IG, including targeting a specific goal to address via a working group by then end of the first 12 months.
    Conduct a Survey with sUAS users and leaders from a variety of disciplines and sectors to draft a report on current sUAS data and metadata practices and identification of the gap between current practices and ideal data and metadata needs. With the goal of publishing this report and hosting a follow up workshop."
Data Economics IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/data-economics-ig,yes,"Introduction (A brief articulation of what issues the IG will address, how this IG is aligned with the RDA mission, and how this IG would be a value-added contribution to the RDA community):
Data is commonly recognized as a resource containing value associated with informetric qualities and measuring scholarly impact [1, 2]. Increased production of data from sensor networks for environmental monitoring, Digital Twins, and IoT devices have introduced another value driven data stream. Data from these developments are increasingly being integrated into data markets and data exchange services that support research and industrial processes [3, 4]. Although these services are generally commercial and require subscription fees or one-time payments for data access and use, they are part of the research data management environment. Furthermore, their design, regardless of a fee, supports FAIR (Findable Ð Accessible Ð Interoperable Ð Reusable) data principles and falling within the scope of RDAÕs mission. This topic warrants further discussion and community understanding on how data value is measured, including the economic value (commoditization) of data. Key issues that align with and add value to the RDA and motivate this proposal, include:
? Informing RDA community about how data value is measured, including exploration of data as an economic good.
? Developing and endorsing a set of shared metrics for measuring the value of data across different environments.
? Linking with other RDA IG and WG where data commoditization has important connections and impacts. For example, the Legal Interoperability IG, Big Data IG, and FAIR and metadata related IGs.
Interest Group on Data Economics (DE) Charter

For these reasons, and to further enrich the RDA community, we propose the Data Economics IG. The IG will build on existing RDA and wider community experience in defining models and related properties (and attributes) to enable data exchange/trading as economic goods (including paid data services) and adoption of the different data economics models. It is important to recognize that paid data services are part of the research ecosystem, however data economics is not limited to financial matters, as value and impact can be measured in different ways. The IG will leverage and extend the STREAM (Sovereign, Trusted, Reusable, Exchangeable, Actionable, and Measurable) properties [5], defined for industrial data as an extension to the FAIR principles. All of these aspects are important factors in forming this Data Economics IG Case Statement.
User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address (what triggered the desire for this IG in the first place):
Real world scenario triggers: Across the global research sphere, the data commoditization is gaining attention. For example, the European UnionÕs initiative, ÒBuilding a European Data EconomyÓ [8] recognises Data Markets as one of the priority topics in the European Horizon2020 Framework programme for 2019-2020 [9] to enable data exchange between industrial parties and increase data effectiveness. Looking specifically at cost and value, there has been research specifically focusing on Metadata Capital [e.g. 10], and, recently the U.S. Academy of Sciences charged a task force with, ÒForecasting Costs for Preserving, Archiving, and Promoting Access to Biomedical DataÓ [11]. Additionally, a number of examples from industry demonstrate practical interest to facilitate and obtain value from data exchange, interoperability, and adopting common architectures for data markets. These includes but not limited to the proposed International Data Space Association (IDSA) Architecture [12]that defined the Data Market and related data exchange mechanisms for industrial data, or recent Open Data Initiative (ODI) by Microsoft and associates SAP and Abode, and others [13]. The examples are all concerned with research data, data valuation, data commoditization, and aspects of data markets, and highlight the need for an international forum and discussion.
RDA community interest: The proposed Data Economics IG is a direct and well supported outcome of the BoF, ÒData as Economic GoodsÓ that took place at the RDA 12 Plenary on 5-8 Nov 2018 in Gaborone. The BoF drew 29 participants from 13 countries; there were four presentations followed by an engaged discussion and support for forming an IG. The BoF agenda and notes are available are made available via the RDA portal [6]. Following the initial BoF gathering, a Case Statement was prepared, and a second meeting took place at the RDA Plenary 13 (P13) in Philadelphia, U.S.A., April 2-4, 2019. This second meeting drew nearly 60 attendees (two times the number of participants compared to the first meeting) from 18 countries. The result was clear interest in establishing the Data Economics IG, and meeting notes from this second meeting are also accessible via the RDA portal [7].

User Scenarios/RDA fit for the Data Economics IG: RDA, as a global organization, is an ideal community to advance discussion on data economics. The Data Economics IG will address the following user scenarios/needs: 1) the need to understand data costs and associated factors, 2) the need create consistent and workable models for measuring data valuation, and 3) the need understand the costs and commoditization related to data markets.
Consistent data pricing/monetisation and data markets models are equally important for government funded and sponsored research, open data and governmental data. The proposed IG will provide a needed, open forum for addressing these scenarios and build important connections with other RDA IGs and WGs.
Objectives (A specific set of focus areas for discussion, including use cases that pointed to the need for the IG in the first place. Articulate how this group is different from other current activities inside or outside of RDA.):
The overriding objective of this IG is the exchange of information about existing developments and initiatives and promotion of best practices in data valuation and data markets and operations. A set of specific objectives are to:
1. Provide and open forum and venue for gathering individuals interested in discussing and defining set of properties that are related to data costs as data as economic goods.
2. Compile initial agreed set of data properties and validate currently denoted STREAM properties.
3. Identify key actions to further research topics and coordination actions.
4. Identify set of documents to be produced by IG, in particular STREAM-like properties definition and overview of business models for research data and commoditized data trading and exchange.
5. Provide input to other RDA WGs and IGs, as well as to other associations and standardization bodies such as BDVA, IDSA, NIST, ISO and IEEE, using existing RDA channels or establishing new channels.
Participation (Address which communities will be involved, what skills or knowledge should they have, and how will you engage these communities. Also address how this group proposes to coordinate its activity with relevant related groups.):
IG members, as a community, will discuss and prepare a set of documents meeting the above objectives, and furthering exploration of the topic of data economics. Communication will be supported by RDA infrastructure, such as the community portal, wiki, and mailing list.

Interaction with other IG and WG is expected, external experts and contributors will be invited. Interaction with external organizations is expected: NIST, IEEE, International Data Space Association.
Outcomes (Discuss what the IG intends to accomplish. Include examples of WG topics or supporting IG-level outputs that might lead to WGs later on.):
At the initial stage of 1-1.5 year, the IG plans to produce a set of documents that prove an overview of existing approaches and concept related to data economic values, data pricing, economical models related to several use cases identified by RDA community on using and managing research data.
Other general outcomes may include:
¥ A framework to increase use and sharing data in secure and economical way; in particular between research community and industry
¥ A metadata scheme defining measurable data properties and data exchange models, which is useful for both the research community and industry.
¥ A shared understanding of economic value as applied to data, that supports broad research collaboration with industry, specifically data.
The IG activity will be driven by community and other expected outcomes will address community needs and requests. In particular, the IG will make the case for creating a taxonomy of the data properties as economic good that be a spin off Working Group."
FAIR Principles for Research Hardware,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-principles-research-hardware,yes,"Introduction:

Research hardware represents a physical artifact and may incorporate mechanical, electrical, and even software components. For example, laboratory equipment which is the result of scientific research represents research hardware. It is an inherent part of research, together with research data and research software. However, while the latter have been recognized as research outputs by funders and institutions (leading to for example the creation of novel career paths in academia), research hardware has not been receiving much attention so far as a research output. This is particularly visible in the absence of hardware making role in the contributor role ontology, CRediT or DataCite Schema v4 (section 7.a), used widely by publishers, and the number of hardware publication platforms (two found in February 2022: hardwareX from Elsevier and the journal of open hardware from Ubiquity Press).

On the other hand, the need for appropriate guidelines for disseminating research hardware has already been recognized in the scientific community (Ezoji, Boujut, & PinquiŽ, 2021). Research hardware is peculiar because: (1) only its documentation can be shared digitally, while physical components are required for its operation and (2) the documentation often contains both (different types of) data and software. In order to conform to open-science practices, research hardware should ideally be shared as Open Hardware (OH) under free and open-source licenses, especially in cases of publicly funded research (Bath Open Source Hardware group). The open source hardware community has also been trying to define best practices in sharing hardware documentation, in order to allow re-use and further development of the hardware, such that they have been advocating for Hardware FAIRness without using this terminology. The work of this IG wants to address both open source hardware as well as research hardware disseminated under intellectual property rights (IPR), as both routes would benefit from FAIRification of hardware.

Available good practices for research outputs disseminated as digital assets and in particular for research data are based on the adoption of FAIR principles (Wilinson et al., 2016). The objectives of FAIR principles in research data are to secure findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of research data by both humans and machines. Similar initiatives emphasized the importance of FAIR principles for research software. The most notable recent work of the FAIR for Research Software group (FAIR4RS WG) in collaboration with other initiatives and organizations led to the definition of guidelines for dissemination of research software that conforms to the FAIR principles. In FAIR4RH Òwe believe that adapting and expanding the FAIR principles for the domain of research hardware can facilitate and improve hardware dissemination practicesÓ. 

While FAIR initiatives for software, data and publishing are integral for research hardware, it is important to recognize that they do not sufficiently address the complexity of FAIR hardware. In particular, the important link between the virtual and physical artifacts, the downstream need for calibration and accreditation, and the variability of expertise in building physical hardware all offer new challenges that require the critical examination of FAIR principles for research hardware. This also includes work on the definition of research hardware, and its relation to open source hardware. Ultimately, this group wants to go beyond that and address obstacles preventing a sustainable and inclusive adoption of hardware documentation in the scholarly commons. We also believe that technical transfer processes of research hardware towards market players, civil society, and other actors may also lead to indirect wider benefits for commons beyond the scholarly community.

 

We believe the groupÕs objectives align well with the RDA interest in fostering the production and publication of non-text research outputs (artifacts that are not manuscript). On the one hand, we hope to leverage the community and experience the RDA has been able to bring to the FAIR4RS WG. On the other hand, this IG will bridge open hardware communities, civic tech, as well as production engineering communities within the RDA.

 
User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address:

    Researchers aiming to build hardware used in a laboratory and field environment, either for performing an experiment or for reproducing experimental results at another lab (e.g., reuse of components, design improvements, etc.),

    Researchers who want to publish their hardware documentation and share it publicly under free and open licenses following open science practices (e.g., for free technical knowledge sharing, defense publishing, increased transparency, open collaborative development with external or joint project partners, maximized technology transfer, etc.),

    Funders and institutions that would want to promote quality and openness in hardware creation in academia,

    Repositories for hardware documentation seeking for methodological guidance.

 
Objectives and outcomes :

 This group aims at the recognition of hardware as an integral part of the research process and foster an inclusive recognition of the people contributing to the hardware design and dissemination. In order to avoid the discussion about patent strategies versus open source hardware and to address both open and ÒclosedÓ hardware, we want to talk primarily about FAIR research hardware. To this end, we identified several challenges, which will correspond to expected outcomes of this group:

    Definition of research hardware

    Analysis of current practices and gaps in research hardware lifecycle:

        Documentation

        Dissemination channels

        Maintainability

    Interoperability of hardware metadata schemas and academic metadata

    Adaptation of FAIR principles for research hardware (see below)

    Identification of practical means of achieving FAIR research hardware

    Contributor recognition systems

 

Specifically, we aim to expand previous work (Miljkovi?, Trisovic, & Peer, 2021) towards the adaptation and expansion of FAIR principles for research hardware. The role model for our group will be FAIR4RS WG as we will elaborate on unique characteristics of research hardware in relation to the existing FAIR principles for data and software. Possible relationships between principles will also be explored. Moreover, we will provide a detailed analysis of current obstacles in application of FAIR principles for research hardware (e.g., transferability of existing FAIR principles, added value, exhaustiveness, interdependencies of FAIR principles, and how to detail/reorient the principles accordingly). In particular, we will emphasize all important factors that influence research hardware (e.g., research hardware documentation, available technology, knowledge, materials, standardized processes, and components (or lack thereof), specific demands for hardware licensing and to the hardware repairability). Additionally, we will focus on the complex dependencies to other hardware and/or software.

 

Importantly, we will put lots of energy into making our work as inclusive as possible and available to everyone. Our outcomes will also take needs, achievements, and practices from Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC) into account as research hardware is a growing field of activity in these regions. Therefore, and following initiatives from the RDA Secretariat, involving communities from the Global South will be one of the objectives of this group.  

 
Participation :

This interest group aims to collaborate with and encourage RDA membership from:

    The RDA community and relevant WGs to facilitate open discussions on FAIR principles for research hardware, 

    OH communities: Gathering for Open Science Hardware (GOSH), Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA), Africa Open Science and Hardware (Africa OSH), Regional GOSH for Latin America (reGOSH)

    Scientific research projects involving OH: Open.Make, OPENNEXT, Open Hardware Delft, 

    Maker communities and other instrumentation initiatives: Open Hardware Observatory (OHO), Materials Equipment 4TU (http://labs.tudelft.nl/),

    Hardware specific organization: Internet of Production Alliance (IoP)

    Metadata producer and users: datacite, OHO, IoP,

    Open Science Aggregators: OpenAIRE, and

    Other interested parties: European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)

 

In particular, we will expand our current collaboration with RDA groups on specific subtopics:

    Persistent-identification-instruments-wg: Metadata schema for research hardware (Julien Colomb is member)

    FAIR4RS-wg: overall strategy, outreach maximization. (Nadica Miljkovi? and Alexander Struck are members)

    RDM4engineering: definition of research hardware, analysis of hardware documentation and maintainability. (Robert Mies is a member)

Mechanism:

On top of asynchronous work, the group will meet online at least every four months to report on thematically distinct subgroups progress.?????

As long as no subgroups are formed, the entire IG has been meeting monthly. Currently, group activities are oriented towards research hardware definition.

 
Subgroups: 

 

In order to tackle the issue of FAIR for research hardware application, we are planning to create subgroups to tackle specific sub-topics, once these subtopics will be set (by the whole IG). Indeed, similarly to what the FAIR4RS group did, three to seven specific topics and point of views toward FAIR4RH will be defined, each one will be worked separately by a subgroup, before these points of views will be merge into one document. We have so far envisaged to analyze the following topics and their relation to FAIR for research hardware principles (this list is neither exhaustive, nor definitive):

    FAIR4research data principles (in relation to hardware)

    Particularities of FAIR4research software principles (in relation to hardware)

    Hardware certification processes

    Open research hardware examples and dissemination practices

    Best practices for open hardware.

 

Each topic will be taken up by a subgroup. Each subgroup will have a manager (to organize the subgroup activities) and a reporter (giving updates to the RDA IG). Depending on the number of members in the RDA, the sub-groups may work concurrently or one after the other.

In the worst case scenario, we will discuss these different approaches consecutively with the whole group.

 
Engagement (especially with LMIC):

The creation of this IG is the first step into gathering a community around the recognition of FAIR hardware as a research output. We hope to get more engagement with our IG after the 2022 RDA plenary, where we planned two sessions to reach a maximum of RDA members. We will reuse this presentation to introduce our group to other communities (for instance, during the GOSH unconference that will be held in Panam‡) or sharing it with specific organizations like Africa OSH or CERN, and directly with researchers developing research hardware.

 

In order to get more engagement from LMIC participants, we have been reaching out to specific local OSH communities like Africa OSH and we will carry on after the plenary and potential RDA endorsement. We will make use of the current momentum toward open source hardware in LMIC (OSHWA lists about 40/143 science projects coming from LMIC) and hopefully we will be able to gather expertise from LMIC researchers and increase RDA membership. In case we fail, we will try to get inputs from LMIC during the open review processes of our outputs, hoping to at least disseminate the outputs of the IG through recognized communities and organizations, with the aim to inform them on our progress"
Data Conservation IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/data-conservation-ig,no,"Building on the work of the Data Rescue IG, the Data Conservation IG will both expand scope to all types of data (both digital and analog), and focus on decision-making topics including:

    How are data sets prioritized for rescue or conservation?
    How are risk factors defined, assessed, and/or categorized?
    How is funding prioritized and/or secured?

More information will be added as the group moves forward. "
Data for Development IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/data-development.html,yes,"Introduction:
The existing difference in data availability, access, use, and distribution between developing and developed countries hinder development for all. For instance, the availability and use of data and statistics on issues such as poverty, education, health, fragile states, pandemics, or natural disasters would trigger a new wave of data-driven scientific innovation and research. However, developing countries experience several bottlenecks, such as limited data infrastructure, data illiteracy, as well as unwillingness by government, private sector, and civil society to make data and statistics readily available.
This Interest group focuses on access to and use of data for the benefit of developing countries, especially vulnerable groups. Vulnerable groups in developing countries can include the rural poor, indigenous people, women, elderly people, immigrants, and children born of war among others. This interest groups intends to work towards achieving interoperable data for development of the low-income countries and vulnerable populations; through creating a platform to promote data and statistics that benefit all, interrogating practices, engaging in capacity building, and suggest sound recommendations that align with many of RDAÕs ongoing and upcoming outputs, recommendations, interest group, and working group activities.
User Scenario:
For the developing countries to achieve inclusive social and economic growth, security and region integration, there is need to strength data literacy, enhance data demand and supply, build partnerships, and establish data governance. This interest group will enhance capacity and contribute to five core areas: ¥ Data and statistical capacity of vulnerable groups ¥ Availability of foundational data and its application in daily life of individuals, organisations and governments ¥ Development of strong data policies and laws to support data revolution in developing countries ¥ Promote meaningful use of data and statistics for regional and international cooperation
This Interest group is concerned with providing a platform to support implementation of RDA outputs and recommendations linked to data, research, policy making, advocacy for citizens of developing countries and interested groups in developed countries to discuss and provide meaningful solutions to enhance the use, access, and distribution of data for development. It intends to support the demand and supply of data and statistics with interoperable mindset and with the priority of protecting and supporting the citizen and the vulnerable populations. It will also build collaborative partnership across RDA interest groups and working groups to work in the field of capacity development in low-income countries.
Objectives:
The interest group follows two broad objectives:
a) Facilitate discussions, improve capacity, and enhance data sharing. In this objective the IG will engage with entities that provide and use data, promote study of development data attributes or and work with government and non-government entities to develop a framework for interoperability of development data which we hope will further form focused working groups.
b) Engage regional and international development groups to assess the quality and limited use of data and statistics for policy, decision making and social transformation. In this objective, the IG will target development groups working on social transformation in developing countries to enhance data capacity and strategies for innovation, research, and social change driven by data and statistics.
Participation:
The IG will reach out to academic research institutions, research networks, organizations, and ministries with whom to collaborate or establish a foundation for collaboration. It is open to discussions relevant to social sciences, humanities, human rights, conflict and development research, vulnerable and hidden populations. The IG will also contact other RDA IG's that are thematically, methodologically, or technically related.
Outcomes:
¥ Offer a forum to discuss important issues related to access to and use of data and statistic for development and to develop recommendations in relevant working groups.
¥ Promote initiatives towards improving the culture of data sharing, respect for ethical issues related to open access, especially the protection of vulnerable populations
¥ Promote discussion and innovation of data and strategies to promote citizensÕ or stakeholdersÕ demand for accountability, and work towards or protection of the rights and privacy of vulnerable individuals
¥ Initiate debate, research and dialogue for networks that enhance innovation, research and policies for data access, use, distribution, and availability in developing countries."
International Indigenous Data Sovereignty IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/international-indigenous-data-sovereignty-ig,yes,"??????The call for Indigenous data sovereignty (ID-Sov) Ñthe right of a nation to govern the collection, ownership, and application of its own dataÑhas grown in intensity and scope over the past five years. To date three national-level Indigenous data sovereignty networks exist: Te Mana Raraunga - Maori Data Sovereignty Network, the United States Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network (USIDSN), and the Maiamnayri Wingara Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Data Sovereignty Group in Australia. Similar initiatives are underway in Hawaii and Sweden. Currently, these networks are engaging in an informal, and somewhat adhoc fashion, to share information and strategies, hold joint events, and collaborate on research. In the last two years alone this spirit of collaboration has produced four events [1], six joint panel/workshops initiatives [2], and a co-edited book, Indigenous Data Sovereignty: Toward an Agenda. Freely available online, the book had about 2,000 downloads within a month of publication, reflecting the very high level of interest in ID-Sov. These efforts notwithstanding, there are resource and infrastructure constraints to advancing the shared goals and aspirations of these ID-Sov stakeholders. What is needed is a more robust and coherent international collaboration to achieve impactful outcomes at the intersection of Indigenous data sovereignty, Indigenous data governance, and research.

The goals of the International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group are clearly aligned with the RDA mission of creating a global community to develop and adopt infrastructure that promotes data-sharing, data-driven research, and data use. Those of us already involved in the national-level networks are strong advocates for data-driven research and data use, and are also working in varied ways to build data capabilities beyond academic institutions, so as to benefit Indigenous communities. Through more effective collaboration, we seek to provide a highly visible international platform for ID-Sov that integrates and leverages existing ID-sov groups to create new opportunities for research and outreach. We also seek to attract new stakeholders beyond our current networks, including researchers, data users and indigenous communities. To that end all three existing ID-Sov networks have developed strong relationships with Indigenous stakeholders including tribes, Non Governmental Organisations, and Indigenous policy institutes, and researchers.

 

            The International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group will add value to the RDA and ID-Sov communities through the following objectives:

    Serving as a platform that leads to the formation of one or more Working Groups. We envisage that our ID-Sov IG would lead to the establishment of a Working Group, with a focus on co-creating an international indigenous data governance framework founded on ID-Sov principles (see below).
    Enabling better communication and coordination across different Working Groups/Interest Groups. One of the important features of ID-Sov is that it has broad relevance and potential for impact across diverse sectors and activities including (but not limited to) agriculture, genetics, archiving, intellectual property rights relating to traditional knowledge, data versioning, and mapping. In addition to sharing strategies and resources within their groups, the IG and WGs will also be in a position to engage with a global community of researchers, policy-makers, and leaders.
    Serving to communicate and coordinate the efforts of the national-level Indigenous data sovereignty networks efforts, fostering synergies, bringing new groups/members to RDA and conversely bringing the WGs activities to the attention of external parties.

 

User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address (what triggered the desire for this IG in the first place):

 

?????Like other nation states, Indigenous nations need data about their citizens and communities to make informed decisions. However, the information that Indigenous nations have access to is often unreliable, inaccurate, and irrelevant. Federal, state, and local governments have primarily collected these data for their own use. Indigenous nationsÕ reliance on external data that do not reflect the communityÕs needs, priorities, and self-conceptions is a threat to self-determination.

The demand for Indigenous data is increasing as Indigenous nations and communities engage in economic, social, and cultural development on an unprecedented level. Given the billions of dollars in research funding spent each year and the increasing momentum of the international big data and open data movements, Indigenous nations and communities are uniquely positioned to claim a seat at the table to ensure Indigenous peoples are directly involved in efforts to promote data equity in Indigenous communities.

The International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group will provide infrastructure and collaboration to advance the shared goals and aspirations of these ID-Sov stakeholders. In addition, the IG provides a platform at the intersection of Indigenous data sovereignty, Indigenous data governance, and research to educate scholars across disciplines share WG outcomes and outputs with

 

Objectives (A specific set of focus areas for discussion, including use cases that pointed to the need for the IG in the first place.   Articulate how this group is different from other current activities inside or outside of RDA.):

?????

Neither an IG nor a WG exists within or external to RDA that focuses on international collaborations on ID-Sov. The International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group objectives include:

    Serving as a platform that leads to the formation of one or more Working Groups. We envisage that our ID-Sov IG would lead to the establishment of a Working Group, with a focus on co-creating an international indigenous data governance framework founded on ID-Sov principles (see below).

Participation (Address which communities will be involved, what skills or knowledge should they have, and how will you engage these communities.  Also address how this group proposes to coordinate its activity with relevant related groups.):

 

?????The International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group will link Indigenous data users, leaders, information and communication technology providers, researchers, policymakers and planners, businesses, service providers, and community advocates together to provide a highly visible international platform for ID-Sov that integrates and leverages existing ID-sov groups to create new opportunities for research and outreach. To that end all three existing ID-Sov networks have developed strong relationships with Indigenous stakeholders including tribes, Non Governmental Organisations, and Indigenous policy institutes, and researchers. We propose to use the RDA Plenary as an opportunity to establish relationships and connections with other IG. We also seek to attract new stakeholders beyond our current networks, including researchers, data users and indigenous communities. Note that IG members need not be Indigenous, so long as they are interested in furthering the aims of ID-Sov, data governance toward ID-Sov, and data-driven research.?

 

Outcomes (Discuss what the IG intends to accomplish.  Include examples of WG topics or supporting IG-level outputs that might lead to WGs later on.): The International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group envisions three categories of outcomes:

 

    Working Groups. We envisage that our ID-Sov IG would lead to the establishment of Working Groups, with a focus on:

        Co-creating an international indigenous data governance framework founded on ID-Sov principles and
        Establishing an international collaborative funding proposal to Indigenous stakeholders in order to design a clear pathway from research to impact.
    Enabling better communication and coordination across different Working Groups/Interest Groups. One of the important features of ID-Sov is that it has broad relevance and potential for impact across diverse sectors and activities including (but not limited to) agriculture, genetics, archiving, intellectual property rights relating to traditional knowledge, data versioning, and mapping.

Mechanism (Describe how often your group will meet and how will you maintain momentum between Plenaries.):

 

The International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group will use the following mechanisms for communication and collaboration.

    Monthly virtual meetings via video conference, shared documents, etc.
    Informal and frequent email contact among chairs and workgroups.
    Monthly listserv messages to IG members from the chairs about IG updates, WG efforts, etc.
    Biannual RDA Plenaries
    Listserv and Facebook group where members may post about Indigenous data sovereignty and data governance resources, current events, and conferences."
Ethics and Social Aspects of Data IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/ethics-and-social-aspects-data.html,yes,"This interest group seeks to create a dedicated space in RDA to discuss ethical and social issues with respect to data archiving, sharing, and reuse. Ethical and social issues occur frequently within the technical and policy work of the rest of RDA. Such issues are complementary to but separate from legal and regulatory aspects which other groups cover, since technology usually outpaces legal precedent, and law itself is underpinned by ethical agreements and social contracts. Our group differentiates itself from other RDA efforts by focusing on the ethical agreements and social contracts that inform and constrain data sharing practices.

Objectives

Primary points of inquiry include the following:

    Understanding the kinds and types of data that can be archived and reused and under what circumstances. How are agreements negotiated and are they upheld throughout the data sharing process?;

    Educating researchers, respondents, administrators, ethics bodies, etc. in the exigencies of data sharing and community supported ethical standards;

    Understanding the grey and difficult areas of research that present unique challenges for data management, such as ÒdangerousÓ, legacy, retrospective, medical, or passively collected data;

    Developing policies and guiding practices that encourage (or, where appropriate, enforce) the ethical sharing of data that protects both the researcher and the respondent;

    Exploring the social obligation to communities where data is collected, whether that be individuals, families, or whole societies. What are the grand social obligations and ethical issues related to data reuse?;

    Identifying emergent issues with potential implications for data sharing: new technologies and tools, scholarly practices, commercial data use, etc.

Participation

The Ethics and Social Aspects of Data Interest Group is open to all RDA members.

Outcomes

The Ethics and Social Aspects of Data group will be considered a success if it generates policies and practice documents providing guidance in challenging ethical situations related to data reuse. Additionally, the group will be a success if it creates a space and continued conversation about the ethical dilemmas that arise from new data sharing practices (both technical and social) within the RDA. This interest group will also, where appropriate, serve as a springboard for one or more working groups focused on specific situations and developing ethical practices and piloting those recommendations (e.g. how to ethically incorporate future data sharing into consent forms for human-subjects research).

Mechanism and Coordination

    Face-to-Face: This group will meet at plenaries to finalize the agenda for the coming 6 month period, to share progress with other RDA groups, and to host important conversations about the ethical and social implications of data sharing.

    This interest group will take advantage of RD-Alliance.orgÕs native capabilities to communicate and collaborate. These include monthly or bi-monthly telecommunications (go-to-meeting) with a planned agenda for discussing specific issues/ cases and continual collaboration to the group wiki.

All interest group documents will be made publically available and be promoted to the RDA community.

RDA for the Sustainable Development Goals IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rda-sustainable-development-goals-ig,yes,"Introduction: Fit with the overall RDA vision and mission

 

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are 17 global goals, with 169 associated targets, which came into effect in January 2016 and will continue to guide UN policy and funding until 2030. Progress on the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals requires broad collaboration within the global data community, as well as nuanced understanding of the barriers for developing information infrastructures. Interoperability of data remains a barrier to collecting, storing, merging, and analyzing data for monitoring SDG metrics effectively - and improving data interoperability may both enhance monitoring, as well as help to enable and support progress towards achieving the SDGs. Achieving interoperable data to advance the SDGs will require best practices, recommendations, technologies, and support of capacity building - which is in direct alignment with many of RDAÕs ongoing and upcoming outputs, recommendations, interest group, and working group activities.

 

Objectives

 

Objectives and scope of the Interest group activities will fall into two categories:

    Improved data management/sharing of SDG indicator data, based on implementation and adaptation of RDA outputs within workflows surrounding the SDGs and NGO development space more broadly.
    Assessing the impact of data infrastructure, and associated quality and limitations thereof, as a component of sustainable development. Defining the value and importance of data infrastructure within sustainable development overlaps directly with the infrastructure-related SDG indicators. More broadly, defining and justifying the importance of data infrastructure will clarify this need to funders supporting development initiatives, researchers and admins supporting the work of development monitoring, and future policy development.

 

Participation

 

Group participation is encouraged for any RDA members working in areas of research, policy, advocacy, data management, or infrastructural support surrounding the Sustainable Development Goals. Such roles include, though are in no way limited to, researchers focused on global sustainability and capacity enhancement, legal experts, data and repository managers, research librarians, and national statisticians.

 

Engagement with existing work in the area

 

    Data for Development IG
    Indigenous Data Sovereignty Group
    Small Unmanned Aircraft
    Health Data IG
    Reproducible Health Data Services Working Group
    RDA/Codata Data Science Summer Schools

 

User Scenarios

 

Achieving successful monitoring of the sustainable development goals requires international data exchange and an array of changes to the culture of science and capacity enhancement activities ongoing in nations wherein data for the SDG indicators are being collected. These capacity enhancement activities fall within four broad categories, all of which overlap with the social and technical challenges to international research data sharing:

    Organizational collaboration
    Data sharing and interoperability
    Data sharing and data governance
    Capacity building

Broadly, the value-add of this Interest GroupÕs activities will be to:

    Create materials to support the implementation of RDA outputs and recommendations within the social and technical work of the UN surrounding the sustainable development goals. These materials will be aimed to support the work of data managers, statisticians, research policy advisers and advocates, and diverse project managers supporting SDG data infrastructure and data use.
    Facilitate organizational collaboration/support with the U.N. and its agencies partnerships in commercial, academic, and NGO space. Facilitating such partnerships will Increase the visibility of the RDA on a global scale, providing precedence for future collaboration with additional IGOs and NGOs. RDAÕs OAB, TAB, Council, Secretariat, and group membership could all play a role in facilitating such partnerships.
    Build collaborative partnerships across RDA interest groups and working groups working within the field of capacity development in low and middle income countries, furthering progressing RDAÕs mission.

Scope of Interest Group:

 

Activities ongoing within the RDA that could align with the SDG

    Conduct a literature review of the United Nations actions for SDGs, the related targets and indicators, and additional efforts ongoing in the space of research data that overlap with the intersection of RDA and the SDGs.
    Landscape analysis of RDA Working Group/IG connections to SDG work, as examined in aim 1
        Draft tabular matrix WG/IG overlap with indicators and OD2I (value chain of data to decisions)
        Build an interactive board/sticker/cards @P14 for WG/IGs to place themselves within the matrix - MILESTONE
        Identify working and interest groups of potential high-impact for SDGs
        Validate matrix in collaboration with selected working and interest groups
    Create an implementation guide advising members of the U.N. working in the areas of Sustainable Development Goals about the applicable RDA outputs and recommendations, strategies for implementation, and available technologies and methods to support implementation.
    Identify examples of implementation: Identify pathways and past success-cases wherein RDA working/interest groups were in collaboration with or implemented by SDG or capacity development work.
    Conduct test adoptions of implementation guide, developed in aim 3, to garner usability and implementation feedback from members of the U.N.

 

 

Mechanism

 

Interest group members will hold bi-monthly meetings via telecom platforms such as Zoom, GoToMeeting, or etc. for all interest group members. These meetings will have running agenda items, reports of ongoing projects, and additional items added given upcoming events or emerging opportunities aligned with deliverables or collaboration with partnering organizations. Co-chairs may also meet outside of these bi-monthly meetings to manage ongoing deadlines. Meeting notes will be made open to the public via the RDA website. Plenary sessions will provide public updates about IG activities and space for community feedback regarding strategy or scope.

 

Potential Projects for Interest Group Scope

 

In preperation of defining the Interest GroupÕs scope and potential objectives, the following activities are proposed:

    Select representatives from the RDA community active in work aligned with the SDGs familiar with strategies for forming organizational partnerships with the RDA.
    Assess key needs/gaps for the UN, funder, and SDG-associated organizations addressable by these RDA activities.
    Recognizing the work of the UN in identifying tiers of SDG indicators and the future needs for SDGs, identify potential alignment of RDA activities that may support UN tier indicator work
        Tier 1: Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, and data are regularly produced by countries for at least 50 per cent of countries and of the population in every region where the indicator is relevant.
        Tier 2: Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, but data are not regularly produced by countries.
        Tier 3: No internationally established methodology or standards are yet available for the indicator, but methodology/standards are being (or will be) developed or tested
    Execute a problem/needs assessment as mapped by the UN and supporting community. Such a needs assessment would likely require conversations, structured surveys, or litereature reviews with UN executives or policies concerning how the U.N. perceives problems/needs, and where RDA may contribute.

In reflecting on the sessions and feedback throughout the p13, some of the major takeaways and potential next steps on SDG work are as follows:

 

Create adoption/output portfolio (aim 3) for the development sector audience. This output portfolio could also frame the value of RDA outputs for various SDG goals, such as #9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (focusing on the value of research data infrastructure supporting sustainability), and #17 Partnerships for the goals (focusing on the value RDA brings in as a large 8,000-strong member community). Such a portfolio could be a brief summary of RDA-alignment with the SDG work and some educational materials, such as a webinar, describing how RDA outputs could be applicable to social and technical issues surrounding work in the SDGs. We'd also thought featuring testimonials of people working in the SDGs who recognize the RDA's benefit or have used RDA outputs in past within their work would be beneficial. We're in contact with members of the RDA summers schools and education for librarians IG who are well-experienced in crafting similar portfolios for targeted audiences, and will continue to explore how such a portfolio could be impactful.

 

Assess existing RDA groups and partnerships aligned with the development sector. Given the diverse RDA outputs and recommendations that could support the SDGS, we will assess their alignment with the SDGs and select representatives from these activities who might be amenable to discussing strategies for forming a partnership with the UN. These representatives may also have previous experience with forming organizational partnerships or may themselves represent a RDA organizational partner.

The aim being three-fold:

    Define activities ongoing within the RDA that could align with the SDGs
    Select representatives active in this work familiar with strategies for forming organizational partnerships with the RDA
    Assess key needs/gaps for the UN addressable by these RDA activities and form a case-statement for a working or interest group.

Many of the topics covered in the IN2N publication could be of interest to the UN and represent the sorts of contributions the RDA-community could offer. Ensuring the final publication reaches the attention of the UN could be a worthwhile strategy."
Social Dynamics of Data Interoperability IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/social-dynamics-data-interoperability-ig,yes,"Introduction (A brief articulation of what issues the IG will address, how this IG is aligned with the RDA mission, and how this IG would be a value-added contribution to the RDA community):

 

Extensive work has been, and continues to be done on data interoperability at the technical and information domains. However, a large portion of the challenges in building interoperable information infrastructures are the result of the interplay between organisations, institutions, economics, and individuals.  Collectively these form the social dynamics that foster or hinder the progress towards achieving technical and information interoperability.

 

These are some of the most difficult challenges to address.  Currently there is only a limited body of work on how to address these challenges in a systematic way.  In keeping with the mission of the RDA, the focus of this group is to focus on what is required to build the social bridges that enable open sharing and re-use of data.

 

The focus of this interest group is to identify opportunities for the development of systematic approaches to address the key social challenges and to build a corpus of knowledge on building and operating interoperable information infrastructures.

 

 

User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address (what triggered the desire for this IG in the first place):

Within Australia, the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) set forth the need to establish a National Environmental Prediction System (NEPS).  This requires the collaboration, coordination and (most importantly) the interoperability between a range of facilities, organisations and government entities for this system to work effectively.  A number of facilities involved have recently come to the realization that the Social dynamics between the facilities is a key factor in the success (or failure) of this initiative.

 

Within the United States, initiatives such as the Pacific Research Platform, the National Research Platform, and the Eastern Regional Network are a few examples of cross-institutional initiatives whose success is dependent as much on social dynamics as on overcoming technical challenges.

 

Within Europe, the need for organisational interoperability is being recognised through initiatives such as the Organisational Interoperability framework, and the work streams in RDA4EOSC.

 

The problem exists at smaller scales as well.  At the institutional level, the need to drive adoption across IT, IT Security, Research units, and Libraries provides a persistent challenge.

 

The BoF session held at the 13th Plenary session highlighted that similar challenges exist within other research domains.

 

There are many solutions that are being applied everyday around the world to address these challenges.  Many of these are conceived and developed through the knowledge and experiences of the individuals involved.  However, at present there is limited systematic knowledge gathered on this topic with a focus on how it can be applied to data and data infrastructures.  Therefore they have limited systematic knowledge to draw upon and therefore it is difficult to identify the good practices relevant to a given situation.

 

For example, the RDA itself is an instrument intended to address some of the challenges that exist in the social dynamics across the global research data landscape.  As such it provides both an interesting case study as well as a representative microcosm of the broader challenges in this space.

 

 

Objectives (A specific set of focus areas for discussion, including use cases that pointed to the need for the IG in the first place.   Articulate how this group is different from other current activities inside or outside of RDA.):

 

Currently there is no other IG within the RDA that has a specific focus on the organisational and social dynamics, (ie: the interplay between organisations, institutions, economics, and individuals) relating to interoperable information infrastructure.

 

The main objective of this IG is to:

    Identify the key challenges relating to organisational and social dynamics that are encountered when establishing or operating data infrastructures.
    Identify a key set of organisational, institutional, economic, and individual challenges that increase the friction to achieving information interoperability.
    Gather case studies that help define the set of problems, and compile a collection of existing solutions that have addressed these problems.  It is acknowledged that often the details of specific case studies could be sensitive and documented case studies may need to be synthesised drawing upon actual cases.
    Develop guidelines, principles as recommendations for practitioners to apply when attempting to address similar problems in the future.
    Develop a corpus of knowledge, including models, frameworks and patterns that can be applied by practitioners to develop the desired social dynamics that reduce friction and foster information interoperability. This could potentially be published as a supporting output once validated.

 

The purpose of this IG is to create a set of outputs which identify common problems and provide illustrative case studies for practitioners to be able to understand the social dynamics that exist in their specific context and to be able to apply this knowledge in their context to influence positive change. 

 

 

                                                                                                                       

Participation (Address which communities will be involved, what skills or knowledge should they have, and how will you engage these communities.  Also address how this group proposes to coordinate its activity with relevant related groups.):

 

The participation in this IG is left open and broad to anyone who has an interest in the social dynamics as it relates to building interoperable data infrastructures.  Specific skills and knowledge that would be useful for this IG include,

    Social psychology
    Organisational behaviour and organisational psychology
    Economics
    Legal frameworks
    Digital anthropology
    Digital ethnography

 

It is expected that many of the topics of interest for this IG will have some degree of overlap with other IGs and WGs within RDA.  It is intended that this IG will keep these related IGs informed of its activity, and seek to coordinate with them on topics that overlap or have a common interest.  It is feasible that in the future we could hold joint sessions at plenary events around common topics.

 

Drawing on the description provided in the RDA website, the following IGs have been identified as potentially having overlapping interests with this IG,

    RDA4EOSC initiative

Outcomes (Discuss what the IG intends to accomplish.  Include examples of WG topics or supporting IG-level outputs that might lead to WGs later on.):

 

The IG intends to have the following outcomes:

    Create a community of interest on the Social dynamics of interoperable information infrastructures;
    Identify a set of common organisational, institutional, economic, and individual challenges that increase the friction to achieving information interoperability.
    Gather case studies that help define the set of problems, and compile a collection of existing solutions that have addressed these problems.
    Develop guidelines, principles as recommendations for practitioners to apply when attempting to address similar problems in the future.

 

Some initial topics that could lead to Working Groups include,

    Problem and solution patterns in Information Infrastructure;
    Governance  & participation models;
    Frameworks for trust;
    Incentives and disincentives for collaboration and participation;
    Specific institutional partnerships known to exist, how they came to be, and their varying degrees of success"
Open Science Graphs for FAIR Data IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/open-science-graphs-fair-data-ig,yes,"Mission

The goal of the Open Science Graphs Interest Group (OSG IG) is to build on the outcomes and broaden the challenges of the Data Description Registry Interoperability (DDRI) and Scholarly Link Exchange (Scholix) RDA Working Groups to investigate the open issues and identify solutions towards achieving interoperability between services and information models of Open Science Graph initiatives. The aim is to improve FAIRness of research data, and more generally FAIR*-ness of science, by enabling the smooth exchange of the interlinked metadata overlay required to access research data at the meta-level of the discovery-for-citation/monitoring and at the thematic level of the discovery-for-reuse. Such ÒFAIR-nessÓ and Òinterlinked-nessÓ provide strong support for research integrity and research innovation which in turn underpin significant social environmental and economic benefits.
Objectives

Open Science is urging scientists, communities, institutions, and policymakers to define and adopt methodologies, practices, and tools for publishing research products, beyond the scientific article, including research data, software, digital experiments, etc. The ultimate goal is to achieve transparency and reproducibility of science. As a consequence of this trend, researchers are depositing into scholarly communication data sources the metadata and files relative to all these products, together with semantic links between them, and towards other relevant entities, such as those kept in registries for authors, organizations, and data repositories (e.g. ORCID, ROR, re3data.org). De facto, Open Science publishing practices materialize a distributed/federated/de-centralized and global Open Science Graph, where by ÒgraphÓ we mean a collection of objects (i.e. scientific product metadata) interlinked by semantic relationships (i.e. claims of object-to-object relationships together with their meaning). Needless to say, there is a great interest to contribute to and/or consume this Graph for sharing, discovering, and monitoring Open Science. To address this, several initiatives are aggregating targeted subsets of such sources to build specialized Open Science Graphs, subsets of the global Open Science Graph, capable of serving specific user needs: Google Scholar, Microsoft Academics, Scopus, FREYA PID Graph, Research Graph Foundation, OpenAIRE Research Graph, Open Knowledge Graph, Human Brain Project Knowledge Graph, as well as the CERIF graphs built via CRIS systems are just a few of the real-case graphs being built and consumed out there.

Clearly, FAIRness of research data strongly relies on the success and diffusion of such graphs, both at cross-discipline level and at the thematic level. Research data (as well as software, or any research object) can be contextualized, thus maximizing its value and ability to reuse, and be reachable via navigation from other related objects. Nonetheless, research data value and related scientific reward may be derived from its constantly updated context, relying on a network of of citations and usage statistics. The general architecture and use cases have been studied by the RDA Data Description Registry Interoperability (DDRI) Working Group. Besides, the RDA/WDS Scholarly Link Exchange (Scholix) Working Group has added significantly to our understanding of the subset of the research data graph connecting data and literature. Both working groups have done extensive work on the implementation of services and community adoption and are today in maintenance mode. However, other projects continue to work on these outcomes, including the OpenAIRE Research Graph, the Scholexplorer graph, Research Graph, and the FREYA PID Graph. Driven by such motivations, the co-chairs of the aforementioned WGs organized a BoF on ÒResearch Data GraphsÓ at the RDA Plenary Conference in Philadelphia, to check on the general interests and possible commitments on this topics, which resulted on this IG case-statement and proposal.

The Open Science Graphs Interest Group (OSG WG) will investigate the challenges and identify solutions towards achieving interoperability between services and information models of Open Science Graph initiatives. The aim is to improve FAIRness of research data, and more in general FAIR*-ness of science, by enabling the smooth exchange of the interlinked metadata overlay required to access research data at the meta-level of the discovery-for-citation and at the thematic level of the discovery-for-reuse. The following main challenges can be identified as the worth of investigation:

    Build a community of Open Science Graph initiatives working together in the context of RDA with a focus on FAIR data;
    Build on and provide input to the outcomes of RDA IGs and WGs such as DDRI, Scholix, PID, Metadata, Go-FAIR, FAIR Data Maturity Model, Data Usage Statistics, and Data Citation; this will be achieved thanks to the current membership of co-chairs to such groups and by inviting co-chairs of other groups to build active synergies;
    Analyse the state of the art in this domain, by making synergies with the tens of initiatives today building Open Science Graphs and provide an overview of current research data graph activities to frame a definition and classification of such graphs;
    Study the foundations of an information model, a lingua franca, that would enable the realization of an interoperability layer facilitating the exchange of information between graphs;
    Discuss the ideal services, protocols, and APIs required to exchange graphs, query graphs, navigate graphs in both aggregation scenarios and federated access scenarios.
    Identify one or more dedicated RDA Working Groups to tackle/address relevant challenges.

Participation
We envisage participation from the following kinds of actors:

    ?  Open Science Graphs information models (e.g. Scholix.org, CERIF, Research Graph, OpenAIRE and PID Graph information models)
    ?  Open Science Graphs providers targeting specific end-users:
        Thematic graphs for scientists
        Citation graphs for scientists, communities, institutions, policymakers, funders
        Monitoring graphs for institutions, policymakers, funders
    ?  Open Science Graphs consumers: scientists, communities, institutions, policymakers, funders

Already Committed

    ?  RDA Data Description Registry Interoperability (DDRI) Working Group (Benjamin Zapilko)
    ?  RDA Scholarly Link Exchange Working Group (Wouter Haak)
    ?  OpenAIRE Research Graph (Paolo Manghi)
    ?  FREYA PID Graph (Martin Fenner)
    ?  Research Graph Foundation (Amir Aryani)
    ?  Thematic Graph (Mark Parsons)
    ?  Open Research Knowledge Graph (Markus Stocker)
    ?  CERIF/EuroCris (Jan Dvorak)
    ?  DBPedia/Wikipedia (Daniel Mietchen)

Interaction Mechanisms

OSG IG members will interact by means of a dedicated D4Science Virtual Research Environment (web site, mailing lists, online file system) and publish documents in Zenodo.org, in a dedicated Collection. The co-chairs will meet virtually three times a year (between plenaries), while members will regularly meet at the RDA plenaries twice a year. Other virtual meetings will be organized to address specific topics by sub-groups of interested members.

 
Outcome

The Open Science Graphs for FAIR Data IG will be considered successful if:

    The main Open Science Graphs initiatives have started to form a community and have identified common goals and challenges.

    The challenges identified above will translate in recommendations and possibly in RDA Working Groups where standards, protocols can be defined and implemented by the committed members of the IG.

    Adequate visibility, participation, and uptake of the recommendations will be demonstrated within RDA and beyond.

GO FAIR Liaison IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/go-fair-liaison-ig,yes,"Introduction

GO FAIR stands for Global Open FAIR and aims at bringing interested stakeholders together to define a practical and concrete approach for implementing the FAIR principles. GO FAIR is organized in terms of Implementation Networks (INs) that are groups of stakeholders that decide to collaborate to define, design and/or implement elements that can contribute to a global platform for data, services and computing capacity interoperability. The GO FAIR Interest Group (GFIG) aims at serving as a bridge between the various GO FAIR INs and RDAÕs Interest and Work Groups.

 
User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address

    From one side, RDA Interest and Work Groups produce a number of guidelines and recommended approaches to deal with several data-related issues and they could and should be adopted by the GO FAIR INs (INs) in their activities. From the other side, the GO FAIR INs often identify issues for what there are no recommended approaches yet. These issues will be brought up to the RDA communityÕs attention by this proposed GO FAIR Interest Group. Some of the identified issues brought from the GO FAIR Ins can be tackled in existing RDA Work Groups and others can motivate the formation of new RDA Work Groups.

 

 
Objectives

    GFIG will establish frequent communication and collaboration with RDA FAIR-related IGs and WGs;
    GFIG will bring recommendations produced by RDA IGs and WGs into the GO FAIR INs for testing and adoption;
    GFIG will bring the results and feedback from the testing and adoption of RDA recommendations by GO FAIR INs back to their related RDA IGs and WGs;
    GFIG will bring data-related issues identified by GO FAIR INs for which proper recommendations are missing to the attention of the RDA community aiming at raising enough interest so interested members of RDA could tackle, eventually by spinning off new RDA IGs, WGs or task forces.
    Create RDA WGs to tackle some of the identified issues.

 
Participation

Both GO FAIR and RDA are initiatives that congregate a diversity of communities from different knowledge domains. In the context of RDA, the commonality is the interest in evolving the current practices in research data. For GO FAIR, this commonality is the desire to contribute to an improvement in findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability of data, services and computing capacity. Therefore, the proposed GO FAIR IG is open to individuals from all communities interested in sharing these goals with contributions ranging from technical definitions of metadata content and semantics to data policy templates.

 
Outcomes

As previously mentioned, this proposed IG aims at serving as a bridge between activities and interests in RDA and GO FAIR. Therefore, the expected outcomes are:

    Closer collaboration between the communities from these two initiatives;
    RDA recommendations tested and validated in GO FAIR Implementation Networks;
    New RDA WGs focusing on issues identified by GO FAIR Implementation Networks;
    New RDA recommendations based on issues identified by GO FAIR Implementation Networks;

 
Mechanism

The GO FAIR International Support and Coordination Office and the GO FAIR Regional Offices keep constant communication with the GO FAIR Implementation Networks. The data-related issues identified by these INs will be discussed with the RDA communities during the planned bi-monthly GO FAIR IG calls and during the RDA Plenaries. Similarly, the RDA recommendations will be brought to the GO FAIR INs attention during the many calls, meetings and conferences organized by GO FAIR. Moreover, there are many RDA members that participate in GO FAIR INs. We will invite them to become members of this proposed GO FAIR IG making the connection between RDA and GO FAIR closer and more direct.

 
Timeline"
Global Open Research Commons IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/global-open-research-commons-ig,yes,"Introduction (A brief articulation of what issues the IG will address, how this IG is aligned with the RDA mission, and how this IG would be a value-added contribution to the RDA community):
The coordination of data infrastructure on various levels (country, continent, discipline, sector) is on the increase. So called ÒOpen Science CommonsÓ or ÒData commonsÓ provide a shared virtual space or platform that provides a marketplace for data and services. Examples include the European Open Science Cloud, the Australian Research Data Commons, the African Open Science Platform, open government portals and initiatives outside traditional research contexts. Coordinating across these initiatives to enable a network of interoperable data commons is the goal, as well as providing greater clarity about what is meant by a Commons in the context of science or research.
The Interest Group will provide a neutral place where people have conversations about Open Science Commons. It will function in a similar vein to the funders forum Ð space will be given to raise topics of mutual interest, track trends and reach consensus on priorities. The Group will work to reach a shared understanding of what a ÒCommonsÓ is in the research data space; what functionality, coverage and characteristics does such an initiative require and how can this be coordinated at a global level? The IG Chairs will also proactively look outside the RDA community to connect with parallel initiatives in other spaces, whether in national / regional contexts or in other fora such as the OECD, G7 Open Science Working Group, UNÕs Expert Advisory Group on a Data Revolution for Sustainable Development, CODATA, GO-FAIR and others. Recognising the broad scope, we will focus initially on Data Commons and extend to Open Science Commons as work progresses.
This Interest Group is closely aligned to the core mission of RDA as it is inherently engaged in building the social and technical bridges that enable data sharing. It will own the overall remit of coordinating the delivery of a Global Open Science Commons and monitor progress made within related RDA Working Groups and other initiatives to achieve this goal. Indeed, the scope is so large that the Interest Group is expected to run for several years and coordinate across many Working Groups, primarily those that are convened within this RDA IG forum but also aligning with existing WG/IG of relevance.
The Interest Group will help to coordinate and steer initiatives, assisting implementers to maintain focus while also providing wider context and meaning. It will encourage and facilitate global collaboration, helping to minimise data silos and adoption of standards and protocols to facilitate a cross-country and cross-discipline global open science commons. The Group will necessarily be large and diverse, representing many different stakeholder groups, sectors and countries. Chairs come from 5 different continents given the breadth of remit and need for genuine global engagement.
User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address (what triggered the desire for this IG in the first place):
This proposal builds on three previous BoF sessions at earlier plenaries which analysed current practice and articulated the need to define areas of overlap which are well-suited to greater coordination and interoperability. The field is now at a stage of maturity where we need to agree on definitions and define a typology to help coordinate work and identify what can be done collectively and what has to be done on an individual basis to progress work in related WGs.
Some very preliminary work has been presented on a typology at the G7 Open Science Working Group in Paris. This draws together the technical layers proposed in NIH data commons work with human factors that also need to be considered. The key initial task for this Interest Group will be to reach consensus on the core components to be addressed.
Existing Open Science Commons initiatives with which we have engaged include the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC), the African Open Science Platform (AOSP), NIH Data Commons, CanadaÕs National Data Services Framework (NDSF), and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) initiative. We intend to connect to other organisational or discipline-specific commons such as the Australian Biocommons,[1] the Data Commons for Food Security[2] and CSIROs Managed Data Ecosystem.
Previous BoF sessions (noted below) have presented some Commons initiatives and progressed discussion to a stage where we have begun identifying key characteristics of the commons to advance a typology and define initial pilot cases for WG activities.
¥ Towards a Global Open Science Commons 11th RDA plenary in Berlin in March 2018
¥ Delivering a Global Open Science Commons at International Data Week in Gaborone in November 2018
¥ Coordinating Global Open Science Commons initiatives 13th RDA plenary in Philadelphia in April 2019
Objectives (A specific set of focus areas for discussion, including use cases that pointed to the need for the IG in the first place. Articulate how this group is different from other current activities inside or outside of RDA.):
The objectives of this Interest Group will build on and take note of activities occurring within national/continental Data Commons in that it specifically aims to bring these together to promote coordination and coherence. Doing so will prevent silos forming - a critical objective since all research is global.
The initial activity of the IG will be to articulate the coverage of Commons initiatives in the research data and open science space to provide an overarching framework to structure and guide work. Reaching consensus on what is and isnÕt a Commons will help to focus activity and avoid mis-application of the concept by those keen to respond to trends.
A significant activity to be undertaken by the IG is to promote a more coherent international perspective on the role of the Commons. Within the EOSCsecretariat project, effort is allocated to engage internationally and promote coherence. Within the ARDC, one of the strategic themes is Coordination and Coherence. Since RDA is recognised as the global forum for discussing such data issues and has coordinated the initial 3 BoFs in this field, these efforts will be encouraged to contribute to and align with the forthcoming IG and WGs.
Participation (Address which communities will be involved, what skills or knowledge should they have, and how will you engage these communities. Also address how this group proposes to coordinate its activity with relevant related groups.):
Participation in the Interest Group will be as broad as possible to cover at least the following knowledge and groups:
¥ Those involved in running existing Open Science Commons, including national/supra-national, disciplinary, institutional and other sector initiatives e.g. government portals
¥ Funders, national ministries and policymakers (addressing research infrastructure policy and research policy) such as OECD, Science Europe and national funders
¥ Research organisations
¥ Research data service providers who contribute to Commons initiatives
¥ Researchers and end users
¥ Parallel bodies in other sectors relevant to this work e.g. International Association for the Study of the Commons
We will pursue links with the National Data Services IG to ensure close collaboration and alignment, possibly including a future merger. Mark Leggott has already been brokering discussions and acting as a liaison between the two initiatives. The Funders Forum is also a critical body of relevance to this Interest Group. We will provide updates for their meetings and explore opportunities for joint sessions with the Funders IG.
Outcomes (Discuss what the IG intends to accomplish. Include examples of WG topics or supporting IG-level outputs that might lead to WGs later on.):
There are four key outcomes on which we expect to deliver or make significant progress towards in the first 12-18 months.
¥ Consensus and alignment around the description/vision of a Commons.
¥ A typology of Open Science Commons to provide a framework for activity, drawing on existing relevant semantic activity where appropriate that is occurring/has occurred within Agrisemantics, Vocabulary Services IG, Metadata IG and related WGs.
¥ A roadmap for global alignment between Global Open Science Commons. This will present an overall trajectory and support the definition of related working groups.
¥ One or more initial Working Groups to conduct focused activity.
Work began on defining a typology for data commons at RDA in Philadelphia. A preliminary draft of a Working Group case statement has also been prepared. We will use the session at P14 in Helsinki to consult on the proposed pilot cases and confirm what remit should be addressed in the initial Working Group. The Interest Group will plan and phase work across multiple Working Groups and ensure alignment with other initiatives.
Although the Interest Group will need a multi-year lifespan, within the first 18 months we expect to have reached consensus on a typology for the commons and alignment of vision. A clear roadmap with stages of phased activity will also be delivered.
Mechanism (Describe how often your group will meet and how will you maintain momentum between Plenaries.):
Chairs will meet every two months, with the meetings being open to contributions from anyone who wishes to participate. A schedule will be published online. Standing items for the meeting include updates from each national/regional or domain initiative and reviewing progress on related WG activities.
Timeline (Describe draft milestones and goals for the first 12 months):
An initial session of the Interest Group will be run at P14 in Helsinki. At this we will advance the typology for the Commons and brainstorm a roadmap for the first 1-3 years.
Other related events are planned which will advance this work. These include:
¥ Sessions on examining Open Science platforms and Research Infrastructures at the CODATA conference in Beijing, China, in September 2019
¥ The EOSC in an international context workshop on Tuesday 22nd October at the RDA plenary, Helsinki
¥ EOSC Symposium on 26-28th November in Budapest (specifically international panel)"
RDA/CODATA Legal Interoperability IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rdacodata-legal-interoperability-ig.html,yes,"Introduction :
The Research Data Alliance Ð CODATA Interest Group on Legal Interoperability of Research Data
(RDA-CODATA WG), proposes to renew its charter. Under a renewed charter, we will serve as a
platform to consider and resolve extant issues around the implementation of the GroupÕs L egal
Interoperability Of Research Data: Principles And Implementation Guidelines (Uhlir et al, 2016) .
To advance the RDA Mission, we believe that the human and technical bridges necessary to
improve data sharing cannot be built without a better understanding and implementation of
legal interoperability practices.
We will formally document post-2016 case studies where interested stakeholders have
surfaced implementation barriers in their communities of practice. We will explore possible
solutions to accommodate stakeholders needs. Where appropriate, and spin off one or more
Working Groups to address the barriers to implementation and recommend promising
solutions.
These Principles and Guidelines explain how open research data should be made available to
everyone in order to achieve legal interoperability in the ideal case. The Interest GroupÕs
recommendation to release data with the most open, legally-sound mechanisms available
(Uhlir et al, 2016, ÔPrinciple 1Õ and ÔGuideline 1cÕ, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.162241 ) derive
from extensive engagement with stakeholder groups; analysis and discussion of foundational
case studies; and extensive consideration of Òopen data without barriersÓ in the legal, policy,
and research literatures.
Yet since its release in Fall 2016, the Principles and Guidelines have elicited feedback and
queries from stakeholders who feel the IGÕs recommendations do not accommodate their
needs.
Four areas of activity for the IG
The implementation concerns surfacing in dialog with these stakeholders fall into four general
categories for consideration:
1. Control of downstream use (variant degrees of openness)
a. Some stakeholder groups interested in implementing the Principles and
Guidelines have expressed concerns with diminished authorial control in relation
to rights waivers (eg, dedicating their works to the public domain) and liberal
attribution-only licenses (eg allowing all forms of modification and reuse, as long
as attribution is provided).
b. Specific examples of additional controls to be accommodated include such
provisions as:
i. The need for liability disclaimers for inaccuracies, lack of timeliness, or
incompleteness in the released data and to limit its liability in the event a
third party is somehow damaged due to the use of the information;
ii. The licensorsÕ desire to be notified of the reuse of his/her data;
iii. The preference to exclude certain applications of the data for purposes
not supported by the data licensor. For example, the Licensor may wish
to limit the rights granted in the information to use in certain geographic
region(s) or are limited for the development of products and services for
certain industries/markets.
iv. The need to address the duration or term of the agreement, what events
will give one or both of the parties cause to terminate the license
agreement early, and the partiesÕ obligations upon termination.
v. The need to outline the responsibilities of both parties with respect to
data protection/privacy laws. For example, a Licensee might request that
the Licensor state that the data was collected in accordance with
applicable law and that all necessary consents have been obtained in
order. Additionally, the Licensor might require the Licensee to promise to
comply with all applicable privacy/data protection laws with respect to its
use of the geospatial information.
2. Need for a licensing scheme that can apply to multipart, heterogeneous objects
packaged within a given data release or submission information package (SIP).
a. In response to calls for greater transparency and reusability in E-Science,
researchers increasingly strive to produce rich representations of their findings
that comprise not only the dataset itself, but also the code, protocols, and
notebooks that facilitate downstream replication and reuse. Different types of
subject matter (e.g. code, content or data) necessitate differences in licensing.
Licenses designed for one type of subject matter Ñ as CC licenses were designed
for content, and F/OSS licenses for code Ñ arenÕt always best suited to licensing
another type of subject matter. Each of these constituent parts may call for
licensing regimes that differ from the other parts. The complexity may increase
as as released products are created using information from a multitude of
sources, each with unique, sometimes conflicting, licensing terms
b. Additionally, the released object as a whole, whether shared as a zip archive, a
containerized Jupyter Notebook, or compiled R markdown website, requires a
metadata record for various purposes (registration of an identifier; indexing by
search and retrieval services; etc) that provides a clear rights statement and
license that is comprehensible by humans and machines.
3. Develop standardized human and machine-readable rights statements as part of
standard metadata.
a. Develop a recommendation on importance of rights statements in metadata that
are human and machine readable. Advocate for these to be made mandatory in
common schema (such as DataCite core schema; ISO 19115-1:2014 metadata
standard for Geographic Information; and analogous and equivalent schema).
Surface and articulate lessons learnt from the cultural heritage community and
existing work under Europeana etc.
b. Develop an ontology of rights statements comprehensible by machines and
humans.
c. Develop recommendations on how to utilize widely-used existing metadata
standards (eg DataCite Scheme for legal interoperability; ISO 19115-1:2014
metadata standard for Geographic Information; and others). These
recommendations would include concrete examples on how to implement the
metadata with respect to legal interoperability concerns, and will address rights
statements, data licenses, software licenses that address data, license stacking,
etc.
4. Monitor, evaluate, and recommend technical means to communicate information
concerning permissions/limitation concerning reuse in a machine actionable manner.
What rights information do machines need to help humans determine legal fitness for
use? (ownership; rights statement; licensing terms and conditions)
a. Are there Machine actionable, human understandable rights expression
languages that could be adapted for research data?
b. Are there emerging technologies eg blockchain that could be used to effectively
handle legal statements made in rights expression language?
Discussions with stakeholders have identified approaches to improve community practices for
achieving legal interoperability of research data. These approaches address needs for control of
downstream use, needs for complex licensing schemes for rich data objects, needs for human
and machine-readable rights statements for metadata, and needs for communicating
restrictions and limitations in a machine-actionable manner.
User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address (what triggered the desire for this IG in
the first place):
The following illustrative case studies collected, documented, and shared by the Interest Group
represent barriers to implementation of the Principles and Guidelines
? The CaltechData repository curates and disseminates atmospheric chemistry d ata from
the international Total Carbon Column Observing Network
(http://www.tccon.caltech.edu/), but is not able to enforce the application of standard
open licenses due to researcher requirements to be notified of reuse and modification
of the data (Agosti, Clement, Egloff, Morrell, 2017, One Repository, Two
Implementations, and a World of Legal Interoperability Opportunities and Challenges,
RDA 9th Plenary, Barcelona, Spain, April 7, 2017, http://doi.org/zenodo.439627 ;
Clement and Morrell, Data Licensing Preferences As a Barrier or Bridge to FAIR: The Case
of CaltechData , Drexel-CODATA FAIR and Responsible Research Data Management
(FAIR-RRDM) Workshop 2019, Phildalphia, April 1, 2019 )
? The Reuseble Data Project in the Biomedicine communit y has devised a rubric and
scorecard for measuring the level of open licensing and legal interoperability in publicly
funded datasets. Findings presented at RDA plenary 10 indicate that approximately half
of the examined datasets demonstrate ÔpoorÕ open licensing practices. (Haendel et al,
2017, Reusable data for biomedicine: a data licensing odyssey, RDA Plenary 10,
Montreal, Canada, September 20, 2017).
https://www.slideshare.net/mhaendel/reusable-data-for-biomedicine-a-data-licensingodyssey
? Researchers in the R Open Science community have been discussing data licensing for
multipart research compendia (R Notebooks) and currently apply a diverse set of
practices while admitting to legal uncertainty
( https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/licensing-for-research-compendia/1581 (Boettig, posting
to ROpenSci Community February 16, 2019.) Proposed models for licensing these
compound objects are found in github repositories of community members (for
example https://github.com/benmarwick/researchcompendium ). The IG will review
and analyze these proposed practices at RDA Plenary 13 April 2019 and will continue to
outreach to the ROpenScience Community to explore best practices.
? Whole Tale initiative (NSF funded out of NCSA): https://wholetale.org/
? GEOFON - A project providing access to seismic data globally collected by researchers
from many research organization and to corresponding software for analysing these
data. The key challenge for this project in respect to open data is the risk that a
competitor may copy all data plus software and start a similar service elsewhere.
Stakeholder groups outside RDA
- Cultural Heritage Community ( https://rightsstatements.org/en/about.html )
- Creative Commons
Objectives (A specific set of focus areas for discussion, including use cases that pointed to the
need for the IG in the first place. Articulate how this group is different from other current
activities inside or outside of RDA.):
The proposed aims of the renewed IG will be four-fold:
1. To document use cases where communities of practice report barriers to implementing
the Principles and Guidelines
2. To explore possible solutions to accommodate stakeholders needs and
3. To prepare a Case Statement in support of one or more Working Groups to address the
barriers to implementation and their solutions
Participation (Address which communities will be involved, what skills or knowledge should they
have, and how will you engage these communities. Also address how this group proposes to
coordinate its activity with relevant related groups.):
The Interest Group has been actively sharing the Principles and Guidelines with interested
researchers, policy makers, librarians, curators, and data managers through numerous venues.
Examples of past engagements include:
1. Teaching data licensing at the CODATA-RDA Summer School and the Force11 Scholarly
Communications Institute;
2. Answering implementation questions with interested groups of researchers and
research data managers such as the NIH-Biomed community and the Belmont Forum
3. Sharing the Principles and Guidelines with interested data sharing and data curation
communities, such as:
a. the OceanBestPractices repository
( https://www.oceanbestpractices.net/handle/11329/295 );
b. OpenAire

as the ROpenSci community; and the model organism community particularly
the editorial board of their new Micropublication: Biology data journal
h. Creative Commons. There will be a session led by a co-chair as part of the CC
Summit 2019 where he will report on the work of the IG, the feedback it got in
its P13 session. Based on this he will seek input from the CC community.
Coordination with RDA-CODATA groups
Data licensing and legal status of research data are core concerns for this IG, but also may be
relevant to other data policy and data ethics groups within RDA. Particular groups we intend to
reach out to for possible input and collaboration include:
? FAIR Data Maturity Model WG
? IG for Surveying Open Data Practices
? Research Funders and Stakeholders on Open Research and Data Management Policies
and Practices IG
? Education and Training on handling of research data IG
? WDS/RDA Assessment of Data Fitness for Use WG
? Blockchain Applications in Health WG (Their knowledge concerning blockchain may be
of interest.)
Outcomes (Discuss what the IG intends to accomplish. Include examples of WG topics or
supporting IG-level outputs that might lead to WGs later on.):
Examples of topics under discussion by the IG that may contribute to the Case Statement for a
new Working Group:
1. Beyond Creative Commons : an analysis of which licences accommodate the needs of
concerned data producers/owners in order to find out if more/new licenses are needed.
This may connect to the efforts of Jane Greenburg et al at Drexel and their NSF funded
project ÒA Licensing Model and Ecosystem for Data SharingÓ
( https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1636788&HistoricalAwards=f
alse )
2. Developing an ethical guide or code of conduct for sharing and using data . The
objective will be for this guide or code of conduct to data rules for a sharing/using ethic
which are to be attached/linked to the FAIR data principles and being formally endorsed
by research communities e.g. via learned societies in order to build a quasi-legal/soft
law set of rules
3. Establishing and promoting Data Licensing guidelines for multi-part data objects. This
output would complement the Principles and Guidelines with an informational resource
and model for how to license the heterogeneous parts of a compound digital object, as
well as the object as a whole
Mechanism (Describe how often your group will meet and how will you maintain momentum
between Plenaries.):
The Interest Group will pursue the proposed scope of work via weekly/fortnightly virtual
meetings and sessions at RDA Plenary. We also propose to organize a face-to-face meeting
in 2019-2020 with a number of options being explored (colocated/pre-RDA events,
Force2019, CODATA meetings, or a free standing workshop at a research institution with
membership in RDA or CODATA). Finally we will continue to collect and share case studies,
published literature, and open educational resources via our shared Zotero database online:"
Data policy standardisation and implementation IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/data-policy-standardisation-and-implementation-ig,yes,"Introduction

Increasing the availability of research data for reuse is in part being driven by research data policies and the number of funders and journals and institutions with some form of research data policy is growing. The research data policy landscape of funders, institutions and publishers is however too complex (Ref: http://insights.uksg.org/articles/10.1629/uksg.284/) and the implementation and implications of policies for researchers can be unclear.  While around half of researchers share data, their primary motivations are often to carry out and publish good research, and to receive renewed funding, rather than making data available. Data policies that support publication of research need to be practical and seen in this context to be effective beyond specialist data communities and publications.

 
Use cases and user scenarios

The prevalence of research data policies from institutions and research funders (such as the UK research councils and European Commission) is increasing (Ref: https://riojournal.com/articles.php?id=14673), so publishers and editors are paying more attention to  standardisation and the wider adoption of data sharing policies. The International Committee of Medicial Journal Editors introduced a data sharing policy; Springer Nature is implementing a standardised research data policy framework with four standard data policy types, each with a defined set of requirements, and is encouraging adoption across all its journals (Ref: https://doi.org/10.1101/122929). More than 1000 journals have adopted one of these policies as of June 2017.  This policy framework is available for reuse by others under a Creative Commons license but requires wider debate in the research and publishing communities. We envisage there to be common elements of research data policy shared between all stakeholders, such as support for data repositories and data citation.

Much of this work draws on earlier Jisc activity in examining the potential for a tabulation of publisher research data policies. Naughton and Kernohan (2016) (Ref: http://insights.uksg.org/articles/10.1629/uksg.284/) reported that the journal data policy landscape was not at the required maturity to be comparable or indexable in this way. Jisc is  therefore committed to working with publishers in supporting the standardisation of journal data policies, with an end goal of supporting machine readable policies that would be easier for researchers and research support staff to utilize in selecting a suitable journal for publication, ensuring compliance with journal and funder data requirements.
 
Objectives and Outcomes

    Help define common frameworks for research data policy allowing for different levels of commitment and requirements and disciplinary differences that could be agreed by multiple stakeholders

    Identify priority areas/stakeholders where policy frameworks can be defined e.g. beginning with journal/publisher policy, then considering funder policy

    For these prioritised areas, stimulate creation of Working Groups to:

        Produce guidance for researchers on complying with and implementing research data policy and the tools to support compliance

    Facilitate greater understanding of the landscape of research data policies across disciplines, institutions and learned societies

    Increase adoption of (standardised) research data policies by all stakeholders in particular journals and publishers

    Connect stakeholders and broaden a collective understanding of their roles and relationships in data policy implementation

The report from the RDA P9 meeting is here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GiJI7kJA3MgDvJyC9zw-zHIbg3n2azhN16W_2Kn1uwM/edit?usp=sharing

Minutes from first informal meeting of this group at RDA 8th Plenary are here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jtJyJVNOXyjondprQXvHH9xJfEDeovhchShi...
 
Participation

While the focus of the policies developed by the Group would be on publishing research data, multiple stakeholders (publishers, institutions, repositories, societies, funders) will be included. Common elements of data policy likely exist for all these stakeholders and this will be explored.

The proposed group would complement the Practical Policy WG (https://rd-alliance.org/groups/practical-policy-wg.html) as this proposed group has a specific focus on journals and publishing with a goal of harmonising and standardising policy. These seem to be prerequisites to and would feed into efforts to create machine readable and actionable policies.

The proposed group would also complement efforts aimed at publishing and citing research data, as data policy of publications should help raise awareness of both these activities.
 
Mechanism

Co-chairs will have regular conference calls (every 1-2 months) and communicate updates to group members via the RDA group mailing list and using other RDA communication resources as needed e.g. group wiki, file repository. Group members will be invited to a group/community call that will take place every 2-3 months, after an initial meeting of the group at the RDA plenary - currently scheduled for April 2017.

We will use collaborative editing tools (Google Drive etc) to rapidly share outcomes of calls, key documents and to solicit feedback from group members."
Engaging Researchers with Data IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/engaging-researchers-data-ig,yes,"Introduction
A brief articulation of what issues the IG will address, how this IG is aligned with the RDA mission, and
how this IG would be a value-added contribution to the RDA community:
Good Research Data Management (RDM) is a key component of research integrity and reproducible
research. Consequently, funding bodies, governments, research institutions and other agencies have
emphasised the value and importance of good data management. However, discussions about data
management and sharing are sometimes limited to librarians, data professionals, or researchers who are
already passionate about data stewardship and open science. In order to implement good RDM practice
within research communities, it is essential to effectively engage with all researchers who produce and
re-use data.
This group will exchange best practices on how to effectively engage with researchers about research data
and develop resources to help various research organisations increase engagement with their research
communities.
The motivation behind this group is to build social bridges that enable open sharing and re-use of data, a
goal that is fully aligned with the RDA mission. To achieve cultural change, researchers, who are the key
stakeholders involved in data production and re-use, must be engaged with the topics of data management
and sharing. The activities of this group will help increase engagement with diverse research communities
across institutions, disciplines, and specialties.
User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to
address - what triggered the desire for this IG in the first
place:
Many interesting initiatives are utilised by research institutions around the world to effectively engage
with their research communities about research data management. Typically, the only way to learn about
these activities is to be lucky enough to attend a conference where a speaker explains their initiative, or to
already know someone engaged in that type of work. This is a fundamentally ineffective way to exchange
and discuss good practice, that disadvantages those who cannot attend conferences, and those beginning
with research data management who donÕt have established connections or know where to look for help.
With these concerns in mind, members of the Libraries for Research Data Interest Group (L4RD IG)
decided to collect information from institutions worldwide on initiatives used to engage with researchers
about research data. This project began within the auspices of L4RD IG, and quickly attracted interested
colleagues from all over the world who wished to join the initially small team of volunteers. At the end,
the project group consisted of 30+ members from 3 different continents, and the group gathered 80+
examples of initiatives from institutions worldwide describing innovative ways to engage researchers with
research data. Of these, 24 were selected and, after further research and interviews with staff that
developed these initiatives, were written up as case studies in the book Ò Engaging Researchers with Data
Management: The Cookbook Ó.
Group members felt that the scope of this project and the interest around it exceeded the current scope of
L4RD IG, meriting the creation of a dedicated interest group to continue the exchange of best practices,
identify new cases, and keep the engagement between interested stakeholders alive (see Objectives).
Additionally, the overwhelming number of responses collected during the survey highlighted engagement
activities that exceeded the scope of the L4RD IG, including activities performed by parts of research
institutions other than libraries such as research groups, individual researchers, IT departments, faculty,
and data centres. Furthermore, some survey responses fell outside the scope of the initial project as they
described initiatives outside of or across research institutions:
- Research Infrastructures (RIs) , that are producing tailored services and training material in
support of their research communitiesÕ needs for effective data management.
- (Example) the CESSDA Data Management Expert Guide is a good example of research
community engagement activity in the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH).
- Active projects on the Open Science and FAIR Data Management spectrum , that undertake
engagement activities to communicate best practices on various areas, as they appear within the
projects timeline.
- (Example) the EOSC Stakeholder report on engagement activities ( D8.5 EOSC
Stakeholder Engagement Report ) which includes a list of recommendations from
successful attempts of their communication team.
- Initiatives that target early career researchers, not only to build capacity, but also to support their
scholarly communication and networking activities.
- (Example) the RDA Early Career and Engagement Interest Group (ECEIG) is a good
example of Mentoring Programmes for research data.
The informal group has also already facilitated engagement with many colleagues who were previously
unfamiliar with RDA. The topic of researcher engagement is important and relevant to virtually all
stakeholders who work with data producers and, as a result, several colleagues who were not RDA
members joined this informal group and RDA because of their interest in the subject. For example, of the
eight colleagues who participated in writing up cases studies, six were not members of RDA. Since then,
four have joined RDA and participated in the Plenary 14 meeting.
During RDA Plenary 14, the group had its first dedicated Birds of a Feather session to solicit feedback on
its charter and agree on the work that the group should be doing. More than 30 people have indicated that
they would like to join the group.
Objectives
(A specific set of focus areas for discussion, including use cases that pointed to the need for the IG in the
first place. Articulate how this group is different from other current activities inside or outside of RDA.):
This group will exchange best practices on how to effectively engage with researchers about research
data, and develop resources to help various research organisations increase their researcher engagement.
Participants in the project would like to keep the group and its forum for information exchange alive to
stay abreast of new innovative activities aiming to increase researcher engagement with research data.
There is currently no venue in the international community where this topic can be directly addressed. In
addition, this is a topic of interest and concern to colleagues outside the library community, and therefore
outside the scope of the current Libraries for Research Data Interest Group.
Furthermore, during the open online peer-review of ÔEngaging Researchers with Research Data: The
CookbookÕ, two groups of people approached the project group. The first group asked if it would be
possible to add cases from their institutions to the case study collection in the future, and the second
wished to be kept up to date about any evaluation or further development efforts of the approaches
described. Both demonstrated broad community interest in these topics and the desire to have a dedicated
forum to facilitate these discussions.
In addition, the group would like to continue working on deliverables. At P14 the participants of the Birds
of a Feather discussion session put forward the following possible projects/outputs:
? A researcher engagement toolkit for low income countries
? A toolkit for researchers, focusing on how to engage librarians and other information
professionals with data management
? Guidelines for what NOT to do when trying to engage with researchers
? Turn existing case studies into informative podcasts
? Develop toolkits for how to get started on initiatives/projects highlighted in selected case studies
? List compelling arguments to convince researchers of the benefits of data management
? List interview questions to convince researchers of the benefits of data management
Many RDA Interest Groups tangentially work in the engagement space, including but not limited to
Libraries for Research Data, the Education and Training on handling of research data IG, and the Active
DMP IG. This group aims to unite all activities related to engaging researchers regardless of domain or
technical perspective. For example, the informal group has already proved useful in bringing both IT,
Library and Data Champions perspectives together into one group. For those new to RDA who donÕt fit
into an established IG this will offer a Ôprofession neutralÕ option for education, learning and best practice
exchange around engagement. This proposed group is distinct, but will need to work in conjunction with
many other groups to highlight and support the engagement of researchers across all disciplines.
Specific objectives of this group are:
? Increase global representation of the current list of innovative case studies included in the
Ô Engaging Researchers with Data Management: The Cookbook Ó.
? Provide a platform for interested stakeholders to exchange best practices on how other
institutions, projects, or initiatives engage researchers with research data on a global scale;
? Inspire each other to implement new engagement activities with researchers about research data;
? Discover and promote activities most suitable for a given institutional setting (according to size,
research profile, resources available for data management, target audience, etc.);
? Discuss specific challenges associated with various tactics and possible tips to overcome these;
? Stimulate collaboration, creation of new connections and cooperation between group members
and beyond.
? Create tools and resources to help others better engage with researchers about research data"
Libraries for Research Data IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/libraries-research-data.html,yes,"Research data have become primary scholarly assets that often require continued access in the dynamic environment of mobile researchers, volatile repositories, transient products and software, and short-lived standards. Libraries have maintained the written scholarly record for centuries, and building on this tradition, librarians have been adapting the principles and practice of librarianship to meet the modern needs of data-driven research and learning.

Libraries have been expanding on their traditional roles and developing new services in the digital environment. This includes collecting, preserving and providing access to research data; as well as offering advice and support to researchers about how to manage research data. The purpose of this group is to build capacity within the library community around research data management, ensure libraries are aligned with other RDM service providers, and share practices as RDM library services evolve and mature. Working groups will be identified and spawned as specific, short-term activities are identified by the group.

Critically, libraries must ensure that they are interoperable with domain data centres and other RDM infrastructures elsewhere. RDA is an important venue whereby the libraries/institutions can interact with other communities including the Domain Repositories Interest Group, the Metadata Working Group, and the Data Publishing Interest Group and bring back best practices developed elsewhere to the library community. In addition, libraries have traditional strengths that they can contribute to RDAs mission of interoperability. Libraries have a long history in terms of collaboration and developing interoperable solutions across multiple domains (e.g. OAI-PMH). They act as a bridge across disciplines and can help to identify commonalities across fields. In addition, IG will actively engage with other RDA groups or form working groups, including Education and Training as well as the Long Tail for Research Data, to ensure there are no redundancies and our work is complementary.

 

Objectives of the Libraries for Research Data Interest Group include:

?      Define organizational and service models to support RDM in research libraries

?      Promote best practices and interoperability of library infrastructures with domain repositories and other RDM initiatives.

?      Develop strategies for embedding data management services at academic and research institutions

?      Identify sustainable organisational business models for libraries in support of RDM

?      Foster the adoption of data-related skills into information literacy instruction for scholars and librarians

?      Act as a conduit to bring together the activities of different regional library groups including IFLA, LIBER, ARL, CARL, etc.

?      Develop advocacy and outreach material for RDM in the research and education communities, in particular with university administrators"
Education and Training on Handling of Research Data IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/education-and-training-handling-research-data.html,yes,"The context of increasing volumes of data being created by researchers and the strengthening of requirements for research data management and data sharing has created demand for a new and evolving set of competencies and skills for researchers who create and use the data, and the growing cadre of professionals who support them.

In general, the fostering of these abilities is not explicitly addressed by current training or formal education plans. Also, the place, role and career structure of support professions (data scientists, data librarians, data managers, data analysts, research administrators, infrastructure providers and developers, etc.) is not clear.

The objective of this IG is the exchange of information about existing developments and initiatives and promotion of training/education to manage research data throughout the data lifecycle. Concretely, it will make the case for creating taxonomies of the skills required by different group of data management specialists/professionals and elaborating reference models as a basis to:

    enable the setting of quality standards for appropriate education and training programmes aimed at researchers and the professionals that support them, at all career stages;
    encourage the recognition of data skills amongst employees, employers, and professional bodies.
    prepare the ground for practical applications applying these standards in educational environments

The potential benefits include:

    increased employability, mobility and recognition of data professionals, including international certification and accreditation, and improved career progression structures;
    better recognition of data competencies and skills as integral components of researcher and support staff attributes;
    increased supply of trained data professionals;
    encouraging innovation in data-related curricula;
    fostering professional associations around recognizable skills.
    coordinating development of framework curriculum for different domains."
Professionalising Data Stewardship IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/professionalising-data-stewardship-ig,yes,"Introduction
A brief articulation of what issues the Interest Group will address, how this Interest Group is
aligned with the RDA mission, and how this Interest Group would be a value-added contribution
to the RDA community.
Data stewardship : the responsible planning and executing of all actions on (digital) data before,
during and after a research project, with the aim of optimising the usability, reusability and
reproducibility of the resulting data . 1
Data stewardship and data management skills are essential in research. The lack of consensus on
the responsibilities, knowledge, skills, and value of data stewards leads to confusion about the
role and hampers building adequate data steward capacity. To our knowledge, a coherent
approach and dedicated training for data stewardship on the (inter)national level is lacking as
well. This, combined with scarce resources for data stewardship at many institutions, limits vital
developments such as defining recruitment procedures and career paths for current and future
data stewards.
At the 14 th RDA Plenary, a Birds of a Feather session was organised on professionalising data
stewardship, with over 60 participants. Eight challenges were identified and discussed: a business
case for data stewardship, data stewardship terminology, the integration of data stewardship
across an organisation, job profiles for data stewards, training for data stewards, career tracks for
data stewards, networking and knowledge exchange, and certification. This was followed by
another Birds of a Feather session at the 15 th RDA Virtual Plenary, which was attended by more
than 100 participants, who reiterated their interest in these topics.
Against this background, this Interest Group will focus on sharing good practices, initiatives, and
projects that could help research organisations in professionalising data stewardship. It thus aims
to stimulate collaboration within and outside the RDA community.
We expect that the activities of this Interest Group will help current and future data stewards as
well as the organisations that incorporate, facilitate and require data stewardship, both within and
across disciplines. This aligns with the grass-roots, inclusive approach of the RDA, and with its

mission to build bridges, exchange views, collaborate on relevant topics, and tackle current
hurdles experienced by the international research data community.
3. User scenarios or use cases the IG wishes to address
What triggered the desire for this Interest Group in the first place.
We identify four direct triggers for proposing the establishment of a Professionalising Data
Stewardship Interest Group.
First, in recent years, many discussions have taken place concerning data stewardship, which is
considered a hot topic in Research Data Management and Data Science. RDA, which is at the
forefront of innovation in research data management, should take a leading role in these
discussions and in shaping the future landscape around data stewardship.
Second, these discussions, and the high attendance rate of the 14 th RDA and the 15 th RDA
Plenary Birds of a Feather sessions, demonstrated the need for professionalising data
stewardship. As a community, we need to ask ourselves what is needed to professionalise data
stewardship. Additionally, we must ask how we can contribute to initiatives and projects aimed at
profiling, organising, developing, and educating current and new data stewards.
Third, there currently is no network that builds on the various useful initiatives and projects on
professionalising data stewardship, such as the FAIRsFAIR project, and the GO-FAIR Data
Stewardship Competence Centers network. A forum, which could bring together the relevant
stakeholders, is needed and we believe that the RDA may actively take such a role, by
establishing a Professionalising Data Stewardship Interest Group. This Interest Group could liaise
with communities, initiatives and projects outside the RDA, thus fostering synergies, facilitating
practice exchange, bringing new groups and members to RDA, and conversely bringing the
Interest Group activities to the attention of external parties (e.g. policy makers, national bodies,
funders, publishers).
Fourth, the very practical challenges identified at the 14 th RDA Plenary and the 15 th RDA Plenary
Birds of a Feather sessions on professionalising data stewardship are a call for action. As an
Interest Group, we could be a platform to lead to the formation of more specific task groups,
stimulating cooperation between members within and outside the RDA to tackle challenges and
set joint, collaborative steps.
4. Objectives
A specific set of focus areas for discussion, including use cases that pointed to the need for the
Interest Group in the first place. Articulate how this group is different from other current
activities inside or outside of RDA.
The Interest Group will focus on exchanging good practices, initiatives and projects that could
help research organisations in professionalising data stewardship. This Interest Group will liaise
with communities, initiatives and projects outside RDA, thus fostering synergies. To our
2
knowledge, there currently is no network that connects and bridges between the various
initiatives and projects on professionalising data stewardship.
Specific objectives of this Interest Group are:
? Provide a forum for knowledge and experience exchange in national and international efforts
to professionalise data stewardship.
? Define challenges which need to be addressed to professionalise data stewardship.
? Design a strategy to tackle the identified challenges.
? Convene task groups, as appropriate, to pursue specific outcomes and deliverables (see
section 4).
? Contribute to global RDA community growth through new members joining this group.
? Stimulate collaboration, creation of new connections and cooperation between group
members and beyond.
? Organise webinars to promote the work of the Interest Group.
This proposed Interest Group is distinct, but will work in conjunction with many other Interest
Groups, initiatives and projects to professionalise data stewardship across all disciplines. A few
examples of complementary RDA groups with which we would like to collaborate are:
? Education and Training on Handling of Research Data Interest Group: experts from this
Interest Group could provide vital advice on training development and this connection
could also facilitate knowledge exchange with regards to existing training resources.
? CODATA/RDA Research Data Science Schools for Low and Middle Income Countries:
collaboration could provide useful perspectives of how data stewardship training could be
applied also to LMIC countries.
? Disciplinary Collaboration Framework Interest Group: collaboration could help determine
which aspects of data stewardship are discipline-specific and how to best address
disciplinary challenges.
? Software Source Code Interest Group: experts from this Interest Group could help
understand what the essential software skills are that data stewards should have and how
these should be incorporated into data stewardship training curricula.
? Libraries for Research Data IG: the libraries are often the drivers for institutional
implementation of data stewardship
? Engaging Researchers with Data IG: it is essential that the groups takes into account the
researchersÕ perspective into professionalising data stewardship
Update October 2020: we have contacted all relevant IG and WG, to find common topics and
actively collaborate. We received a lot of enthusiastic replies from their co-chairs so there is a lot
of potential for future collaboration. We are currently planning to organise an open kickoff
meeting to present ourselves to other IG and WG and make joint plans/set joint steps in the near
future.
3
Below we list the specific challenges identified at the 14 th and the 15 th RDA Plenary Birds of a
Feather sessions on professionalising data stewardship, which are explained in more detail in a
separate document . 2
? A business case for data stewardship : case studies and a framework on how to convince
both the institutional management, as well as the research community about the need for
professional data stewardship.
? Data stewardship terminology : community-agreed terminology and skills for data
stewardship, in collaboration and based on existing work, frameworks and taxonomies
(e.g. Terms4FAIRSkills, CReDiT).
? Models. How to best integrate data stewardship within an organisation? How should
data stewardship be organised within institutions? The group will produce a framework
and case studies to help decide what works best and when.
? Job profiles for data stewards : there exists a great variety of jobs that includes some
role in data stewardship, with varying tasks, with different skills required, and different
degrees of expertise. The group will produce job profiles and case studies to explain the
different types of data stewards roles.
? Training for data stewards : there is currently no agreed, coherent and sufficient
approach to training for data stewards. The group plans to work with multiple
stakeholders internationally (such as FOSTER, RDNL, CODATA, GO FAIR) to evaluate
existing training, look for any potential gaps and devise strategies how these could be
addressed through collaboration.
? Career tracks for data stewards : data stewardship is not yet recognised as a career.
There are not many examples of what a career path would look like, as there is
insufficient experience. The group will gather case studies and produce a report on career
path examples, specialisation profiles, job profiles and payment schemes, with
recommendations for employers.
? Networking and knowledge exchange : there is a need for data stewards to be part of a
community in order to share knowledge and practice. But how to organise such
communities? The group will collect case studies as well as a document with top
principles to create a common ground for community formation/practice exchange.
? Certification : the community also wished to explore the need of certification of training
programmes for data stewards and of data stewards themselves (including a possibility of
online certification).
5. Participation
Address which communities will be involved, what skills or knowledge should they have, and how
will you engage these communities. Also address how this group proposes to coordinate its
activity with relevant related groups.

This Interest Group brings together those interested in professionalising data stewardship, and,
more specifically, in actively engaging with each other to contribute to current discussions about,
initiatives and projects on tackling challenges in professionalising data stewardship.
This may be current or future data stewards, but we also actively reach out to people in the
broader data professional community, including data librarians, data managers, data scientists,
data archivists, IT staff, research support staff, policy makers, funders, and managers and
executives. This explicitly includes students and researchers, potentially being our future data
stewards.
At the 14 th RDA Plenary Birds of a Feather session, over 60 international participants expressed
interest in joining the Interest Group, including actively engaging in its activities (see the list in
Potential Group Members). The participants represented various stakeholder groups (Fig. 1),
which demonstrates that the topic of professionalising data stewardship is highly relevant for a
broad range of audiences.
Fig. 1. Stakeholder groups represented at the 14 th RDA Plenary Birds of a Feather session
(Mentimeter survey results).
Participants also had different involvement in data stewardship, which provided an additional
confirmation of interest in data stewardship across various stakeholder groups (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2. Involvement in data stewardship among the participants of the 14 th RDA Plenary Birds of
a Feather session (Mentimeter survey results).
Additionally, over 25 participants of the 15 th IDCC unconference session on data stewardship
training and certification have shown interest in joining the Interest Group (their names are added
to the list in Potential group members).
The global interest in the topic was reiterated at the 15 th RDA Virtual Plenary Birds of a Feather
session of the group, which was attended by over 100 participants. Crucially, more than half of
the attendees who participated in the Mentimeter online survey indicated that they would like to
actively contribute to the activities of the group (Fig. 3).

Fig.3. Interest in active contribution to the activities of the group expressed by the attendees of
the 15 th RDA Virtual Plenary Birds of a Feather session (Mentimeter survey results).
In addition to coordinating with some of the existing RDA groups (as indicated in section 4), we
will keep connections with existing initiatives and projects on professionalising data stewardship
to reinforce each other, instead of repeating work. Over the last year, the potential co-chairs of
the Interest Group have actively engaged with related initiatives, such as FAIRsFAIR,
Terms4FAIRSkills, the EOSC pilot (FAIR4S), the Edison network, and the Dutch
professionalising data stewardship project by ZonMw/NPOS (which is chaired by one of the
potential co-chairs).
6. Outcomes
Discuss what the Interest Group intends to accomplish. Include examples of Working Group
topics or supporting Interest Group-level outputs that might lead to Working Groups later on.
For the very practical challenges identified at the 14th and the 15th RDA Plenary Birds of a
Feather sessions on professionalising data stewardship, we jointly set the possible outcomes of
the Interest Group for the eight challenges identified and discussed in section 4. For this, we will
distribute a survey to decide and prioritise topics, define concrete deliverables for each topic, and
divide tasks, which will result in specific task groups and working areas for the Interest Group .
7. Mechanism
Describe how often your group will meet and how will you maintain momentum between
Plenaries.
7
The group will meet in person at RDA Plenaries to exchange new ideas and tactics for facilitating
professionalising data stewardship, and also to update each other on the progress of task groups
working on specific deliverables. Plenary meetings will also be used as an opportunity to recruit
and engage with new members.
Between Plenaries, the group will communicate through the formal RDA Interest Group page
(posts and events) and Slack, as this proved to be very effective in another project one of the
potential co-chairs is involved with (ÔEngaging Researchers with Research Data: The CookbookÕ,
which led to an Interest Group in formation, namely the Engaging Researchers with Data Interest
Group).
Separate task groups will be formed to work on specific deliverables and people will work on
these between Plenary sessions. These task groups will be coordinated by the potential co-chairs
of the Interest Group.
In addition, the group will organise regular webinars to stimulate discussion and practice
exchange.
8. Timeline
Describe draft milestones and goals for the first 12 months.
The first Birds of a Feather session of the Group was at the 14 th RDA Plenary. Following the
ambition of the participants to establish a formal RDA Interest Group, after the session, a draft
charter has been written, and shared for feedback with the 75+ prospective members. The charter
was further discussed during dedicated Birds of a Feather session at the 15 th RDA Virtual
Plenary. Subsequently, the draft charter will be submitted to the RDA for official consideration.
We propose the following activities, goals and milestones for the first 12 months after
formalisation:
? Create the official RDA Interest Group:
- Launch the official group page on the RDA website, and provide a link to the charter, as
it contains detailed information about the challenges we aim to tackle, including expected
RDA outcomes (a draft group page has been already created in preparation for the 15th
Virtual Plenary).
- Transfer the existing list of members in the charter to the official RDA mailing list.
- Ask for co-chair nominees, including formal voting.
Update october 2020: as we find it important to have co-chairs from various regions,
including Africa, Asia and the global south, we have actively tried to engage members
and potential co-chairs from those regions. Elections have been held, and as a result, this
includes new co-chairs from various regions. See
https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/professionalising-data-stewardship-ig for the full list
of co-chairs.
8
? Distribute a survey to decide and prioritise topics, define concrete deliverables for each topic,
and divide tasks, which will result in specific task groups and working areas for the Interest
Group.
? Formalise task groups and start working on prospective new outcomes (see section 4).
- Convene a session at the following Plenary.
- Report on the progress of individual task groups.
- Presentation and discussion about new developments in professionalising data.
- Encouragement of new members to join the task groups.
? Organise webinars to promote the work of the Interest Group.
? Communicate and align with various stakeholder groups, initiatives and projects within and
outside the RDA, thus fostering synergies on professionalising data stewardship."

CODATA/RDA Research Data Science Schools for Low and Middle Income Countries,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/codatarda-research-data-science-schools-low-and-middle-income-countries,yes,"Introduction (A brief articulation of what issues the IG will address, how this IG is aligned with the RDA mission, and how this IG would be a value-added contribution to the RDA community):
The goals of this RDA Interest Group are to continue the information sharing, targeted outreach and community collaboration with RDA members about the CODATA-RDA Schools for Research Data Science. At this point, there have been two very successful schools hosted by the International Center Theoretical Physics in Trieste :- the first being held in August of 2016 and the second in July of 2017. Both were held in Trieste, Italy. There are two planned upcoming events, one in Sao Paulo in December 2017 and a third Trieste school in August 2018. We are also looking into an African school in 2018. We plan to continue providing open and evolving curriculum materials, creation of a practical framework for hosting regionalized instances of the course, and focus on train-the-trainer concepts to grow regional capacity. This is aligned with the RDA mission in that it enables data sharing through its training and adds value to the RDA community by teaching some of the outputs of the RDA in Research Data Management.
User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address (what triggered the desire for this IG in the first place):
The school curriculum focuses on Open Data and FAIR practices, ethical data use, and builds a foundation of Data Science skills for early career researchers in all disciplines. The attending researchers are given priority based on a World Bank ranking of Low or Middle Income Countries (LMICs), so the focus is on resource constrained researchers. This specifically speaks to the RDA Vision of ÒÉresearchers and innovators openly sharing data across technologies, disciplines, and countries to address the grand challenges of society.Ó In the past RDA as an organization and its recommendations and outputs have been introduced to the schoolÕs students. While the events thus far have targeted LMICs, the curriculum should have universal application for Early Career Researchers (ECRs) worldwide. 
Objectives (A specific set of focus areas for discussion, including use cases that pointed to the need for the IG in the first place.   Articulate how this group is different from other current activities inside or outside of RDA.):
á      Continuing to provide successful School for Research Data Science Events.
á      Creating a framework for hosting of regional events.
á      Providing ECRs with a foundation of skills necessary to thrive in an Open Science and Open Data environment.
á      Grow a base of worldwide trainers prepared to lecture, mentor, and provide support to future worldwide and regional events.
á         Continually evolve the foundational Data Science curriculum designed for this course, along with making it accessible and reusable for other projects with similar goals.
This is distinct from other groups within the RDA.
Participation (Address which communities will be involved, what skills or knowledge should they have, and how will you engage these communities.  Also address how this group proposes to coordinate its activity with relevant related groups.):
¥	The communities targeted for students are ECRs in LMICs with interest of need of a foundation in Data Science skills and resources. They should also embrace the concepts of Open Science and Open Data.
¥	The communities targeted for lectures and mentors are any Research Data Science professionals or academics interested in developing the next generation of Data Scientists in LMICs. This includes, but in not limited to RDA Members.
¥	NGO and Corporate sponsorship will need be leveraged for successful hosting of events.
¥	While the effort within this group is focused on LMICs the materials, academic program and hosting framework created by this working group are generally adequate for worldwide consumption and reuse. We welcome participation and sharing with non-LMIC communities and will work with all communities to adopt our curriculum and materials.  
Outcomes (Discuss what the IG intends to accomplish.  Include examples of WG topics or supporting IG-level outputs that might lead to WGs later on.):
¥	Continued successful instances of the RDA/CODATA School for Research Data Science.
¥	Continued growth of lecturer and mentor base to regionalize training events and reduce the cost per event by leveraging local experience and talent.
Mechanism (Describe how often your group will meet and how will you maintain momentum between Plenaries.):
Regular event planning meetings will be held prior to upcoming scheduled events and targeted outreach events. A CODATA Task Group will continue to meet about governance, funding, curriculum evolution and operation of the project. We will leverage the RDA IG as an information sharing and recruiting platform."
Early Career and Engagement IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/early-career-and-engagement-ig,yes,"Introduction
The purpose of the Early Career and Engagement Interest Group (ECEIG) is to provide a focal point
for Early and Mid-Career Researchers and Professionals, including those involved in various
RDA-related fellowships and Early Career programs.
User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address
RDA members recognize that there is a need to create a space in RDA for those who are at the
beginning stages of their careers. Specifically, RDA members recognized that Early Career
Researchers and Professionals usually need additional support for:
1. networking amongst themselves to learn about other Early Career scientists and their
research, i.e., establishing a Ònetwork of peersÓ, and
2. mentoring from senior RDA members who are interested in mentoring Early Career
Researchers and Professionals.
Designating time on each RDA plenary schedule for this IG is important because those who are in the
beginning stages of their careers have their own unique talents and strengths and they represent the
next generation of RDA; they are critical to the future of RDA. At a BoF conducted during RDA P8 in
Denver, CO a group of Early Career fellows agreed to explore the idea of creating an IG centering on
those who are in the early stages of their careers and helping them effectively engage with RDA.
This effort was continued and crystallized at a dedicated networking session during RDA P9 in
Barcelona, Spain.
Objectives
While other efforts exist in RDA to support Early Career Researchers and Professionals, such as the
RDA-US and RDA-EU fellowship programs, the RDA ECEIG seeks to complement existing efforts by (i)
building a peers network, (ii) maintaining a ÒliveÓ document of advice for Early Career Researchers
and Professionals and (iii) creating opportunities for formal and informal mentoring within RDA.
Specifically, objectives of this IG are to:
1. Focus on Early Career Researchers and Professionals because they need the most support
2. Establish a volunteer-based mentoring progam
3. Network across domains to establish an interdisciplinary network of peers
4. Provide a space for people who have more experience with RDA to pass on knowledge and
lessons learned to Early Career Researchers and Professionals
5. Create a social outlet specifically for Early Career Researchers and Professionals
Participation
The ECEIG is open to all RDA members to participate, and is of particular interest to Researchers and
Professionals in the Early and Mid-Career stages. This IG is also of interest to more experienced RDA
members who desire to mentor and support Early and Mid-Career Researchers and Professionals.
Outcomes
The ECEIG will provide anchoring to Early Career Researchers and Professionals by giving them
visibility and a place to speak, as well as pointing them to what is relevant within RDA and sharing
experiences. Driven by the needs of its members, this IG will focus on providing practical advice such
as how to get the most out of your RDA experience, how to speak at a session, as well as establishing
and sustaining a network with different people in a friendly environment built on mutual support.
This knowledge and compendium of advice will be maintained as a ÒliveÓ document, constantly
being updated and reviewed by members of this IG. Additionally, having a formal mentoring
program is of significant value and impact to Early Career Researchers and Professionals, therefore
recruiting (both disciplinary and cross-disciplinary) will be an integral part of this IG. Beyond the
formal structure of a Plenary, this IG will incorporate a social dimension by organizing lunches,
drinks, meeting spaces and other social gatherings.
Mechanism
The ECEIG will utilize capabilities provided by the RDA platform to communicate and collaborate
effectively to achieve its goals. These include:
? A designated time and space in each RDA Plenary, dedicated to Early Career Researchers and
Professionals, similar to the ÒWomen in RDA BreakfastÓ tradition.
? An established, informal social gathering in each Plenary (to be organized by current IG
members).
? Feedback by the new members in the IG on how the RDA is beneficial for them and how it
can be improved.
? Monthly telecoms/web conferences with planned agendas to discuss specific issues, with
recorded video sessions for future reference
? Asynchronous collaboration using google docs, a wiki, a dedicated forum and an electronic
mailing list. Of particular importance is the forum, as it would allow all involved parties to
discuss, elaborate or pose questions to the members on general and domain-specific topics
at any time."
Research Data Architectures in Research Institutions IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/research-data-architectures-research-institutions-ig,yes,"Introduction

The Research Data Architectures in Research Institutions Interest Group is primarily concerned with technical architectures for managing research data within universities and other multi-disciplinary research institutions. It provides insight into the approaches being taken to the development and operation of such architectures and their success or otherwise in enabling good practice.

 

An institutionÕs research data management infrastructure consists of more than just a data repository and discovery mechanisms. It includes the underlying storage technologies, the networking, hardware, system interfaces, authentication mechanisms, data brokers, monitoring platforms, semantic interoperability tools, long-term preservation services, high-performance and high-throughput computing facilities, data science platforms, and potentially many other technologies that process data and control the flows of data and metadata between systems.

 

Seamless data interoperability and movement between different systems both local and in national or disciplinary services is a particular challenge at present, given the need to provide researchers with a smooth and efficient user experience Ð a key requirement for any research data service. Governance and policies, project management environments, and communications platforms are also vital elements in shaping and informing IT architectures, as is the management of business information associated with research.

 

This IG seeks to understand the various architectures used by institutions globally, identify pain points within those architectures, and learn from those who have overcome or avoided those pain points.
The general approach of this IG is to encourage discussion about architectures and enable interested parties to collaborate and learn from one another. Many institutions are at present planning and working towards overarching data management architectures, and there is a legitimate concern that without such a forum as is provided by this IG institutions will relive the same experiences and repeat the same mistakes as their peers.

 
User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address

The Research Data Architectures Interest Group treats the following user scenarios:

    Knowledge support for research data infrastructure architects, and project and service managers
    Knowledge sharing regarding enterprise architecture best practises  at multi-disciplinary research institutions
    Development of a greater understanding of objectives and goals between different stakeholders at research institutions, including  management, infrastructure developers, research data engineers,  IT systems architects, and technology vendors.

 
Objectives

The main themes of the IG are

    Exploring how diverse tools, technologies, and services can be integrated to meet the evolving needs of researchers in research institutions.
    Considering interoperability between institutional research data infrastructures and (inter)national or discipline-based infrastructures
    Understanding the different institutional approaches to governance structures and business processes in responding to research ICT demands (e.g. capacity planning/forecasting for storage)
    Sharing case studies of solutions developed by data infrastructure projects in research institutions
    Presenting technical innovations and ideas that can further the development of integrated research data infrastructures
    Agreeing best practice relating to research data architectures in research institutions

This group has connections with some other RDA groups, such as:

    National Data Services IG Ð research institutions frequently support, use or deliver services and solutions provided by national data service vendors or operators, and these therefore form part of an institutionÕs architecture
    Repository Platforms for Research Data IG and Research Data Repository Interoperability WG Ð repositories are an essential component of research data architectures, but need to be considered as one element of a larger infrastructure
    Data Fabric IG Ð technology and interoperability solutions for research institutions are an essential part of the bigger picture)Storage Service Definitions WG (formerly ÒWG QoS-DataLC DefinitionsÓ) Ð storage definitions, vocabularies etc. are important for achieving mutual understanding of research data architectures

The IG differs from these RDA IGÕs or WGÕs in following areas:

    The scope of the group is institutional-level solutions and architectures rather than for national or disciplinary-specific architectures, although it will be important to consider the relationships between these different levels
    The Group will discuss technological solutions at research institutions at the enterprise architecture level, not focus on a single element in isolation

 
Participation

The target audience of this IG includes anyone involved in research data infrastructure planning projects or services as well as researchers with an interest in systems, technologies and data flows at the institutions level. This includes research data infrastructure project managers, ICT architects, senior managers with responsibility for research IT services, developers, data managers, data engineers, and data scientists. Also representatives of the service or technology vendors and data industry are welcome.
 
Outcomes

    Outcomes of the IG:
    Shared knowledge about research data tools, infrastructures and architectures
    Knowledge base for best practises and lessons learned log
    More specific outputs will be determined by the participants in this IG, but might conceivably include:
    Shared repository of architectural diagrams
    List of technologies used for specific purposes, and their interfaces
    Landscape report and gap analysis

 
Mechanism

The Interest Group will hold regular meetings at RDA plenaries (if accepted in the schedule). Between Plenaries the IG will collect case studies and examples of good practice and add these to the open know"

Virtual Research Environment IG (VRE-IG),https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/vre-ig.html,yes,"Introduction (A brief articulation of what issues the IG will address, how this IG is aligned with the RDA mission, and how this IG would be a value-added contribution to the RDA community):

 

The vision of the Research Data Alliance (RDA) is that Òresearchers and innovators openly sharing data across technologies, disciplines, and countries to address the grand challenges of society.Ó The Mission of RDA is that it Òbuilds the social and technical bridges that enable open sharing of data.Ó

Increasingly researchers who are not co-located are seeking to work dynamically together at various scales from the local to global using the internet to share data, models, workflows, best practices, publications, management and administration of their research etc. The Virtual Research Environments Interest Group (VRE-IG) seeks to build the required technical bridges, skills and social communities that enable global sharing and processing of data across technologies, disciplines and countries through the creation of shared online virtual environments. As these individual VREs grow, inevitably they need to also connect with other major research infrastructures.

 

The goal of the VRE-IG is to identify the technical issues to and, where known,  share solutions that enable online access to data and other research assets required to address issues that can range from local challenges (which are also potentially of direct relevance to researchers in other geographical areas or other research domains), to the research grand challenges currently being faced by society on global issues, e.g., societal impacts of climate change; sustainable cities; and environmentally sensitive utilisation of the scarce resources of our planet.

 

User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address (what triggered the desire for this IG in the first place):

    Domain specific VREs are being built in individual nationally and regionally funded research projects (e.g., geophysics, environment, hazards mitigation). Although the data sets being accessed are of national extent, can these tools be utilised for development of similar VREs, such as for geophysical inversions, species tracking, flood prediction and mitigation)?
    A new group wishes to develop a shared virtual research environment - what are the best practices defined for how to technically build and sustain a VRE?
    Building a VRE requires specialised skills - what are those skills and how can they best be shared?
    As a VRE grows it will inevitably link with major infrastructure initiatives such as European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), the US Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) and the Australian National Research Data Cloud (NRDC) Ð but how to connect to these?
    How can a community around online access to and processing of major data resources be built and maintained?
    How to access and build gateways to major supercomputer or cloud resources to enable processing of data in data intensive scientific environments?

 

Objectives (A specific set of focus areas for discussion, including use cases that pointed to the need for the IG in the first place.   Articulate how this group is different from other current activities inside or outside of RDA.):

VREs are synonymous with Science Gateways (SGs) in the USA and Virtual Laboratories (VLs) in Australia, and are increasingly being used to support a more dynamic approach to collaborative working across the internet. The proposed VRE-IG will explore all aspects of existing and planned future VRE/SG/VLs with the aim of moving towards common policies and best practices, such as those now being promoted by the European EOSC, the US XSEDE and the Australian NRDC. There is currently no coordination of the development of the underlying architectures, as well as specifications for components and interfaces in any of these initiatives, nor is there any agreed best practice way to connect to the major research infrastructures, in particular data to compute resources. Likewise there is also no mechanism for sharing best practice, skills, tools and software that connect tools to data in online environments that could ultimately allow these individual VREs to interoperate on a global scale. The goal of the VRE IG is to encourage initiatives tasked with developing these technologies to create Ôbuilding blocksÕ of common data infrastructures and build specific Ôdata bridgesÕ to enable online sharing and in situ processing of data. The US SGCI (begun in August 2016) is starting to work on these challenges for the US and will closely collaborate with this IG.

 

The VRE IG will aim to act as a longer-term organization responsible for tracking and contributing to the evolution of VRE/SG/VL technologies, particularly as they relate to data access. It will also seek to engage with those making use of these online technologies in an effort to identify the necessary technical aspects, social and community building practices, required skills, as well as governance issues and best practice required to support a more coordinated approach to the development of collaborative environments that enable data sharing and in situ online processing.

 

The proposed VRE-IG group is in effect, an Ôumbrella groupÕ that brings together:

    Those initiatives that are actively developing VRE/SGs/VLs internationally;
    Representatives of the common eInfrastructure (eIs) services e.g. EUDAT, EOSC, XSEDE, NRDC, etc.; and
    Specific RDA groups (e.g., software citation, metadata IG, Versioning IG, etc.), which are developing outputs, that are themselves best practice inputs to research groups developing VREs.

 

The objectives of the VRE-IG are to

    Review the state of the art and compare/contrast existing VREs, VLs and SGs;
    Ensure associated relevant technologies are highlighted to IG participants so that they are aware of them and understand their potential to enhance their own VRE efforts, particularly those that enhance online access to data and enable in situ processing;
    Compare architectures used for a VREs that facilitate connecting people to the required resources online (data, tools and compute) (it may be feasible to develop a reference architecture as a dedicated Working Group);
    Propose specifications for standard components (software and interfaces) for a VRE/SG/VLs;
    Propose best practices for VRE/SG/VLs development and implementation, in particular definition of best practice for building communities around and sustaining VREs;
    Contributing to the SGCIÕs scientific software collaborative to build a central information hub for researchers and developers seeking to connect data, tools and compute infrastructures online; and
    Suggest policies to stakeholders VREs in close collaborations with existing foundation projects and initiatives e.g. VRE4EIC, SGCI, XSEDE, OSG, NRDC, etc..

 

Participation (Address which communities will be involved, what skills or knowledge should they have, and how will you engage these communities.  Also address how this group proposes to coordinate its activity with relevant related groups.):

 

The proposed VRE-IG is domain-agnostic and is relevant to the academic, government and industry sectors. It will bring together experts in data, tools and compute resources. The group already has 92 members, who truly reflect this diversity of interest.

 

The proposed VRE-IG will engage with the relevant IG/WGs including:

    Software Citation IG
    Metadata IG: definition of packages of metadata elements appropriate for the VRE/SG/VL
    Metadata catalogue WG which will potentially provide resources for documenting the metadata used in different VREs
    Preservation Tools, Techniques and Policies IG
    Research Data Provenance IG
    Reproducibility IG
    Federated Identity Management IG
    Data Fabric IG
    Domain groups for use cases, requirements and possible later validation
    Mapping the Landscape IG

 

In addition, the register of VREÕs and components of VREs being developed by the SCGI, will be entered into the RD-A Mapping the Landscape IG Inventory ( https://sciencegateways.org/resources/catalog  and https://catalog.sciencegateways.org/#/home)

 

Outcomes (Discuss what the IG intends to accomplish.  Include examples of WG topics or supporting IG-level outputs that might lead to WGs later on.):

VRE/SG/VLs and associated technologies have matured in the last 10 years as evidenced by the evolution from more one-off, bespoke, single workflow systems developed by a specific set of researchers, to loosely coupled platforms shared by many groups of researchers. If the objectives outlined above for the VRE IG can be achieved it will lead to interoperating VRE/SG/VLs across multiple domains and where feasible, supported by integration of underlying national e-RIs.  The alternative is divergent and heterogeneous systems that will have high maintenance costs and are incapable (or only capable with great effort) of interoperating: these more bespoke, more specialised systems have well known issues of long-term sustainability."
"Preservation Tools, Techniques, and Policies",https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/preservation-tools-techniques-and-policies,yes,"RDA Interest Group Draft Charter Template
Name of Proposed Interest Group: Preservation Tools, Techniques, and Policies

Introduction (A brief articulation of what issues the IG will address, how this IG is aligned with the RDA mission, and how this IG would be a value-added contribution to the RDA community):

The Preservation Tools, Techniques, and Policies (PTTP) IG provides a forum to bring together domain researchers, data and informatics experts, and policy specialists to discuss such issues as:

    What data/software/artifacts/documentation (hereafter referred to as Òknowledge productsÓ) should be preserved for sharing, re-use, and reproducibility for a given research domain? For other domains?
    What tools are available for researchers to preserve these elements in a manner that does not obstruct or hinder their research?
        What are the strengths and weaknesses of these tools?
        Are there common features that could allow tools from one domain to be re-used elsewhere?
        Are there tools that archives/repositories could provide that could make preservation much easier for researchers?
        What are the longer-term development goals of each of these tools?
    What preservation policies exist, imposed by government agencies, publishers, or other actors? How are they changing? How are they implemented? What are their strengths and weaknesses?
    How can preservation policies be implemented in a way that aids research both now and in the future?
        How does this depend on the tools provided?

Through the course of these discussions, the PTTP IG acts to strengthen the dialogue between domain researchers and the data community by focusing on how researchers are enabled to use previously generated and preserve new results. This enhanced engagement amplifies the voice of the research community within the fabric of RDA. The additional focus on policy considerations, by nature nation-, agency-, and organization-specific, serves to illustrate the means by which research preservation can be encouraged (or required) and the implications of these policy decisions.

Given that one must preserve knowledge products before one can (usefully) share them, the mechanisms by which this preservation happens is primarily in the hands of the researcher and should be a critically important element to the mission of the RDA. The quality of the data and the information relevant to their creation can only be guaranteed by the researcher who produces the data. Thus, it is in the RDAÕs best interest to consider this an integral part of its progress.

This group has obvious synergies with the Reproducibility IG, the Provenance IG, the Active Data Management Plans IG, and the Preservation e-Infrastructure IG, among others. It entirely complementary in charter/focus with the existing Preservation e- Infrastructure IG.

User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address (what triggered the desire for this IG in the first place):
Largely absent from formal RDA deliberations thus far have been discussions of how researchers can interact with repositories in order to preserve their findings. Most researchers do not consider preservation as part of their research workflow, and, when confronted with an unfamiliar repository interface for data ingestion, are unable to provide the information required. They do not, as a matter of course, use tools that allow the automatic generation of the necessary metadata and other information that is necessary for preserving the knowledge behind their research results. In fact, for many researchers, the situation is represented by the (re-purposed) familiar cartoon, below:

The PTTP IG will operate in the Òoverlap spaceÓ that is (somewhat unfairly) represented as empty in the above figure. The IG will explore how knowledge preservation is currently being done, what tools exist, what are their strengths and shortfalls, and how policy considerations are (if at all) driving preservation strategies, preservation tool development, and preservation tool adoption. These discussions are extremely urgent given the impending implementation of Òopen dataÓ policies from all US funding agencies and the corresponding move in the EU in this same direction. The knowledge preservation tools for most researchers are either inadequate or woefully under-adopted. This clash between the research enterprise and policy can only be resolved with discussions between the primary stakeholders. RDA is the only global forum that currently provides an opportunity for these discussions. By encouraging increased participation by domain researchers in these important discussions, the PTTP IG can make significant contributions to solving one of the most important issues around data and research.

 

Objectives (A specific set of focus areas for discussion, including use cases that pointed to the need for the IG in the first place. Articulate how this group is different from other current activities inside or outside of RDA.):

Following from the issues listed above, the PTTP IG will:

    Catalogue available preservation tools, including capabilities, compatibilities, and rates of adoption, and make this information available to researchers and archivists. This catalogue will serve as a basis for discussion of tool development and deployment in order to better meet the needs of diverse research communities.

    Undertake outreach activities, including holding sessions at RDA plenaries and conducting outside workshops to engage researchers and archivists in preservation tool specification and, potentially, adoption.

    Engage related RDA IGs: Metadata, Provenance, Reproducibility, Active Data Management Plans, Preservation e-Infrastructure; and domain-specific IGs in a wider dialogue around preservation needs, tools, and the specifications thereof.

    Survey preservation policies across countries, funding agencies, and research areas to assemble a comprehensive view of researcher and archive responsibilities

    Engage representatives of funding agencies, either at RDA plenaries or at other workshops, in order to involve them in the details of these discussions.

     

Participation (Address which communities will be involved, what skills or knowledge should they have, and how will you engage these communities. Also address how this group proposes to coordinate its activity with relevant related groups.):

The PTTP IG seeks to connect domain researchers with data scientists and data-handling professionals in order to improve, first, the communication between them, and second and more important, the tools the researchers use to preserve the knowledge inherent in their research results. If this is taken as a primary goal, the communities involved are quite broad: all researchers on one hand, and all those whose goal is to provide the platforms for preservation and access on the other. This second community is currently the main constituents of RDA, and they are quite engaged already. Emissaries of the research community are also enthusiastic RDA members. The PTTP IG will prevail upon this smaller cadre for outreach (or in-reach) to other researchers who should be involved in the discussions. Several means will be exploited to achieve additional in-reach or outreach to broader communities, including attendance at scientific society meetings or at domain-specific conferences. Additional, smaller workshops outside of RDA plenaries may be a more targeted way to attract additional participation and dialogue. Extensive networks of interested researchers exist; the task is to bring more of them into the conversation.

In terms of coordination, members of the proposed IG have already coordinated two joint sessions at the 8th RDA Plenary in Denver with two of the related groups, the Reproducibility IG and the Active Data Management Plans IG. IG leaders from the Provenance IG and several of the discipline-specific groups were also attendees at those sessions. Thus, coordination is already occurring. Maintaining open lines of communication and combining meeting sessions when appropriate should be relatively straightforward.

Outcomes (Discuss what the IG intends to accomplish. Include examples of WG topics or supporting IG-level outputs that might lead to WGs later on.):

A. As mentioned above, the PTTP IG intends to produce two catalogues/reviews:

    A taxonomy of preservation tools, including their features, strengths and

    weaknesses, and their rates of adoption in various research domains

    A survey of open access policies worldwide

B. A primary outcome of this IG will be better communication between the data scientist/archivist realms and that of the domain researcher

C. A primary outcome of this IG will be wider adoption of preservation tools by domain researchers

D. A primary outcome of this IG will be the delineation of desirable characteristics and features of scientific preservation tools for future tool development

A potential WG project would be to choose a pilot research domain with no good preservation tools and to solve that particular problem in a manner that isnÕt completely domain-specific.

 

Mechanism (Describe how often your group will meet and how will you maintain momentum between Plenaries.):

The PTTP IG will have meetings every month to six weeks, partially reflecting on issues raised by previous plenary meetings, and planning for the next round of plenary sessions. Significant attention will also be devoted to accomplishing the goals of the IG, namely greater researcher participation and the development of the proposed catalogues of tools and policies. Planning of additional workshops, when appropriate, will certainly keep the level of engagement high. "
Repository Platforms for Research Data IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/repository-platforms-research-data.html,yes,"Charter
The RDA Repository Platforms for Research Data working group will gather and analyze
research data use cases in the context of repository platform requirements. The primary
deliverable will be a matrix relating use cases with functional requirements for repository
platforms.
Value Proposition
As of the writing of this case statement, several communities in the research data realm
somewhat Ògrope in the darkÓ when it comes to choosing, utilizing, deploying or developing
the best possible repository platform to meet particular research data needs:
? Research institutions, including universities, often have an institutional repository that
was set up perhaps a decade or more ago to primarily accommodate documents, such
as dissertations, papers, or preprints
of articles. They are now facing mounting
demands for research data support, wonder whether or how their existing repository
can meet these demands, and often have a difficult time identifying suitable
Page 1 of 6
alternatives, be it as a replacement of or in addition to their existing repository (see
some of the Related Work further below for examples).
? Developers of repository software may have created their product and its features for a
particular set of use cases (for instance, for ÒOpen DataÓ in government agencies) that
they believe they understand well, but they cannot easily make their platform useful
and known to other potential implementers with research data (such as in universities,
companies, or applied research institutions).
? Researchers with very specific data use cases may be caught in the middle of the two
aforementioned groups: their institutions may not know of alternatives to whatever
repository platform they (may) already have, or be unwilling to explore them for lack of
broader understanding of the alternativesÕ functional capabilities? and the developers
of repository platforms may be disinclined to address those use cases without knowing
if they are more broadly applicable in the research data community. As a result,
researchers may spend time, energy, and money away from their actual research to
patch together repository(like)
solutions to their own data needs.
The primary target audience for the aforementioned matrix consists of developers and service
providers of repository software. The functional requirements will influence the development
of repository software and related services to better serve the use cases of the research data
community.
Secondary audiences for the matrix may include:
? repository managers interested in identifying functional requirements that will satisfy
specific use cases in their institution, consortium, or subject domain?
? grant applicants who need to satisfy funder requirements by writing a research data
management plan, which very likely includes aspects related to repository platforms?
? funding agencies whose funding application reviewers may be aided by a listing of
what may be expected from research data repository platforms? and
? researchers who may need to guide their institutions in selecting repository platforms
for their emerging data needs.
Engagement with Existing Work
The proposed WG members are not aware of current work that would overlap with, or
duplicate, the proposed activity. Following are links to work that focused on specific use
cases, institutions, and/or repository platforms:
Related Work
? Open data and the academy: an evaluation of CKAN for research data management
? Kaptur Technical Report
? Edinburgh DataShare Ð Reflections from a Data Repository Manager
? Dataverse Network Pilot at North Carolina State University
? SURA Reports Findings from Data Management Pilot
? How to Evaluate Options for a Research Data Catalogue & Repository
Page 2 of 6
Many of the proposed WGÕs members are expected to already be users, implementers, or
developers of repository platforms for research data, or to be exploring such activities, so their
awareness of ongoing related research in this area should feed proactively into the WGÕs
ongoing work.
Work Plan
Deliverables
Matrix of Functional Requirements
This matrix will align a list of distilled research data use cases with functional requirements
related to repository platforms. These requirements may also relate to specifications for a
generic API, particularly in terms of interoperability and workflows. Each use case will tick a
box under one or more functional requirements, indicating that the use case may be satisfied
with a repository platform that supports the related functional requirement(s). The intersection
boxes of use cases and functional requirements may also contain values expressing the
importance or usefulness of the functionality for the use case, with details of that to be
developed by the proposed WG.
Part of such a matrix might, for illustration purposes, look like this:

Use Case and Functional Requirement Documentation
In support of the matrix, each use case and functional requirement will be described in more
detail. Use cases will follow a narrative, user story format that Òcaptures the 'who', 'what' and
'why' of a requirement in a simple, concise wayÓ . This documentation 1 will serve as a
reference for anyone looking for more detail on a particular use case or functional requirement
from the matrix.
The review of specific repository platform products visavis
functional requirements or use
cases is outside the scope of the proposed WGÕs activities, but may be informed by its output.
Milestones
Initial Use Cases
One of the first milestones will be an initial list of use cases that is deemed to be
representative of the broad needs of the research data community. This list will need to be
edited, distilled, and analyzed in order to identify common themes and requirements.
List of Functional Requirements
A master list of functional requirements will be created as use cases are analyzed. This
master list will be produced before combining the use cases and functional requirements in a
matrix.
Mode and Frequency of Operation
The working group will primarily communicate asynchronously online using the mailing list
functionality provided by RDA. Online voice meetings will be scheduled as needed? likely once
per month. When possible, inperson
meetings will also be scheduled? these will take place at
RDA plenaries and at other conferences where a sufficient number of group members are in
attendance.
Addressing Consensus and Conflicts
Group consensus will be achieved primarily through mailing list discussions, where opposing
views will be openly discussed and debated amongst members of the group. If consensus
cannot be achieved in this manner, the group cochairs
will make the final decision on how to
proceed.
The cochairs
will keep the working group on track by setting milestones and reviewing
progress relative to these targets. Similarly, scope will be maintained by tying milestones to
specific dates, and ensuring that group work does not fall outside the bounds of the
milestones or the scope of the working group.

Community Engagement
The working group case statement will be disseminated to mailing lists in related communities
of practice related to research data, in an effort to cast a wide net and attract a diverse,
multidisciplinary
membership. Group activities, where appropriate, will also be published to
related mailing lists and online forums to encourage broad community participation.
Adoption Plan
The documented matrix of use cases for research data and functional requirements for
repository platforms will be disseminated to members of the primary and secondary
audiences mentioned under the Value Proposition via the methods mentioned in Community
Engagement. They will be asked to provide feedback to the working group on what specific
use cases the WGÕs output helped them to address, how useful the documented matrix was
to them, and where additions or improvements to it could be made in future iterations. This
feedback will determine whether a followup
WG should be established or the current WGÕs
efforts continued, depending on the RDA governance guidance for that at the time."
RDA/WDS Certification of Digital Repositories IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rdawds-certification-digital-repositories-ig.html,no,"In order to guarantee data sharing, the long-term preservation of these data in sustainable digital repositories is a sine qua non. Data that are created and used by science and scholarship need to be managed, curated and archived, making sure that the substantial investments in preparing and presenting the content and tools will not be lost. Researchers need to be sure that the resources the repositories offer remain meaningful and usable over time. Moreover, the repositories themselves need to have sustainable business models.

Preservation and sustainability raise challenges in many areas. The main issues related to long term preservation and sustainability remain basically unresolved, as many organizational, technical, financial and legal aspects remain open. Certification is therefore fundamental in guaranteeing the trustworthiness of digital repositories and thus in sustaining the opportunities for long-term data sharing.

 

The Interest Group will build on previous work in the area of certification. It will deliver the global overview and the necessary recommendations and requirements that allow the effective implementation of certification of digital repositories on a national, European and even global level.

Archives and Records Professionals for Research Data IG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/archives-records-professionals-for-research-data.html,yes,"Introduction 
The objective of this group is to explore the areas where the principles and practices in the information disciplines of archives, records management, and research data curation overlap and where they diverge. Archives and records professionals serve in a range of critical roles: as experts in ensuring access, preservation, and reuse of records and archival collections; as provocateurs for good records curation practices; and as advocates for the construction of sustainable infrastructures for information sharing. Examining alignments in theoretical frameworks, practical implementations, and goals among archivists, records managers and data curators will lead to the development of a vibrant community of information professionals sharing expertise and working in a more interoperable way across different domains.   

The proposed IG is explicitly aligned with RDAÕs goal to build social bridges that enable the open sharing of data. Specifically, the IG will build relationships among professionals who are committed to developing data sharing frameworks and practices that are able to withstand the various challenges introduced by the passage of time: technological obsolescence, loss of contextual understanding of data, and resource constraints that make it impractical to commit to preserving all data forever. By creating a space for archivists, records management professionals and data curators to come together, this IG has the potential to act as a launching pad for RDA Working Groups that will produce recommendations addressing these fundamental challenges to research data sharing, specifically by bringing preservation, arrangement and description, and appraisal methodologies from the archives and records professions to the wider RDA community. This IG also aims to bring the skills and competencies which have long existed in the archives and records management communities into the wider RDA community - many of whom will not be aware of this existing expertise.

User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address 
?	Broadly, the research data community has concerns related to the vital, foundational questions about which data should be kept, by whom, for whom and for what period of time. Archives and recordkeeping professionals already have long-standing theoretical frameworks and successful practical implementations of appraisal and retention methodologies that could serve the RDA community well in this area.
?	Participation in conversations about data curation that are already taking place in archives communities -  for example, at the Society of American ArchivistsÕ 2015 meeting - has generated desire to formalize these discussions with our colleagues in archives and records management via a forum endorsed by RDA.

Objectives  
?	To provide a forum for discussion of how archives/records management principles can apply to data curation.
?	To communicate and coordinate with archives/records management professionals who may be outside of RDA to foster synergies, bring them into RDA, and bring the IG and relevant WG activities to the attention of the archives/records management field.
?	To advocate for record professionals within the RDA community.

This group will complement the activities of existing groups such as the Libraries for Research Data IG, the Data Rescue Interest Group, and the IG Education and Training on Handling of Research Data.  Support by these groups for the proposed IG Archives and Records Professionals demonstrates that other existing RDA groups already acknowledge and support the role that recordkeeping professionals currently play in research data management.

Participation 
The group is aimed at recordkeeping professionals: that is, trained archivists and records managers, who may have responsibility for research data management in their organisation. We intend to engage with this community via their specific professional communication platforms, for example archives- or research data curation-specific listservs. 

We also intend to bring relevant archival methods and expertise to the attention of research data sharing and preservation communities. 

As part of the support for this group by the Education and Training for Research Data IG and the Libraries for Research Data IG, there will be coordination of relevant activities.
 
Outcomes 
 Increased participation in RDA by recordkeeping professionals
?	Practical recommendations to the RDA community for addressing at least the following issues:
?	appraising data
?	developing and implementing retention schedules for data
?	strategies for improving access to research data collections
?	education in good data creation practices, preservation, and reuse
?	Increased impact of RDA outputs via their effective amplification across archive and record keeping professional networks

Mechanism 
The IG will use the RDA-provided email list to share news and generate conversation, and will connect where relevant with existing professional mailing lists where already in existence. In addition, we will meet via teleconference on at least a quarterly basis to discuss projects and report on relevant initiatives taking place at our own institutions.
 
Timeline
March 2017: IG meeting at Barcelona Plenary

Engagement
The IG will continue to increase group membership via the Archives and Records Association (UK and Ireland), JISC Research Data Management Group, Society of American Archivists, etc. In addition, the IG has identified members who will act as liaisons to key groups (see table below). 

Organization Name	Cross Member
InterPARES	Darra Hofman
IASSIST	Laurence Horton
ICSU CODATA Data at Risk Task Group	Elizabeth Griffin
International Council on Archives	Rebecca Grant

Digital Curation Centre	Laura Molloy

Activities
At the Denver Plenary, the IG identified 4 themes on which to focus our attention. The overarching aim of the discussions in Denver was to determine activities based on these themes might evolve into Working Groups. The activities stem from a conversation on what added value archives and records management professionals might bring to RDA on existing IG/WG topics, and how these other IG/WGs might be engaged by our group.

Themes
1)	Digital preservation 
?	Potential outcome: creating a publication which suggests achievable levels of preservation from minimal to best practice (similar to the 5 Star Open Data principles) could be both informative and useful. This should be based on extensive research and consensus from the Archives group.  The development of this document will be steered by records professionals, whose training encompasses data appraisal, the creation of collections, and metadata generation as well as preservation. These recommendations will therefore be based on a strong theoretical foundation, as well as practical experience of preservation and its related issues.
2)	RDA Recordkeeping
?	Continued discussion around idea of conducting focus groups and/or interviews with RDA stakeholders to get a better sense of their recordkeeping needs. Also discussed how IG members can provide insight and feedback to the RDA/US Data Fellow who is working on the RDA Recordkeeping project. 
3)	Education and Training
?	Proposed an examination of the DigCurV digital curation curriculum framework in order to check its usefulness for the archive professional. The structure - (i.e. 1. Practitioner; 2.middle / programme / project manager; 3. Senior executive) would lend itself well to a structured understanding of the skills and competences for the archivist working with digital holdings. The IG hopes to find a lead on this project by the 9th Plenary.
4)	Appraisal
?	Develop a community generated literature review, hosted on the RDA site. This will involve a call for literature/citations and will allow for feedback and suggestions on use from the community. The literature review could also be used for outreach into various RDA IG/WGs such as Libraries, Data Rescue, etc. for collaboration, conversations, and next steps.  
?	Develop domain specific reworkings of the DCC guidelines on appraisal. The audience for the domain specific guidelines would be people/organizations with little or no access to archival professionals in their organization. Would include identifying groups to work with from RDA (WG/IG), and determining what work has already been done or already exists."
IGAD Community of Practice,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/igad-community-practice,yes,"Introduction: A detailed articulation of what issues the CoP will address, how this CoP is aligned with the RDA
mission, and how this CoP would be a value-adding contribution to the RDA community.
The Interest Group on Agricultural Data (IGAD) came to life in Gothenburg (Gšteborg, Sweden) in 2013 at the beginning of
the Research Data Alliance (RDA) and has since grown to include over 260 registered members, from across continents.
IGAD is a domain-oriented interest group working on all issues related to food and agricultural data. It represents
stakeholders in managing data for food and agricultural research and innovation, including producing, aggregating and
consuming data.
Beyond this, IGAD promotes good practices and RDA Recommendations in the research domain, including data sharing
policies, data management plans, and data interoperability. As a forum for sharing experiences and providing visibility to
research and work in food and agricultural data, IGAD has become a space for networking and blending ideas related to
data management and interoperability. It also provides fertile ground to reach out and promote projects among other
international organizations and institutions working in food and agricultural research and innovation. On a logistical level,
one of IGADÕs chief roles is to serve as a platform that leads to the creation of domain-specific Working Groups.
This document presents the reasons why IGAD should transition to become the ÒImproving Global Agricultural DataÓ
Community of Practice, described further in the ÒObjectivesÓ section. Benefits and alignment with RDA goals are described
below under the Value Proposition section.
2. User scenario(s) or use case(s) the CoP wishes to address, and what triggered the desire for this CoP in the first
place.
Scenario1: A regional network of agricultural data managers that has not yet engaged with the Research Data Alliance
discovers RDA and seeks the best groups to participate in. Because IGAD is the designated community for agricultural data,
the new network is quickly connected to like-minded experts and oriented to ongoing activities and how they can
participate in RDA. Ideas from the new network are introduced to the conversation, leading to a new working group, and
RDA recommendations flow into the new network.
Scenario 2: A funding opportunity for a multi-national collaboration arises and some members of IGAD want to pursue this
opportunity. In order to demonstrate that their collaboration will be informed by and benefit the global community, they
discuss the opportunity with the larger IGAD community. Community members provide supporting letters and in some
cases, offer commitments of shared purpose. The coordinated support from a wide variety of stakeholder groups, each
representing facets of prospective user community, indicates to funders that the project is highly likely to succeed. As the
project proceeds, the CoP maintains high awareness of its progress and has plenty of opportunities to shape its direction
and benefit from its outputs.
Scenario 3: Technically-oriented RDA working groups are seeking use cases for their developing standards in applied areas
such as agriculture. Due to the large international nature of the CoP, IGAD can provide multiple perspectives; these provide
excellent test cases, and even important, edge cases, for emerging ideas from these non-domain groups.
Scenario 4: Some IGAD CoP members belong to institutions and networks that lack capacity to travel or build extensive
infrastructure. Yet these members play a critical role in their home countries for realizing Sustainable Development Goals
such as ending hunger. The IGAD community can work to include these members in global conversations about solutions,
and foster collaborations and leadership development that lead to more equitable access to information and technology.
3. Objectives: A specific set of focus areas for discussion and action.
To illustrate our primary objective, we introduce a new name for our group that maintains the IGAD acronym: Improving
Global Agricultural Data.
Our more specific objectives/priorities can be added as ÔsubheadersÕ to the name, for example:
? IGADs Semantics
? IGADm Management
? IGADw Workforce
? IGADs Sovereignty
? IGADs Capacity Building
? IGADi Infrastructure
A subset of these objectives will be chosen for each year.
4. Value Proposition: A specific description of who will benefit from the creation and animation of the CoP and
what tangible impacts should result.
Agricultural data practitioners and the organizations they work for will benefit due to:
? Better alignment with global practice.
? Opportunities to form partnerships on specific projects.
? Better ability to impact stakeholders via improved data systems and practices.
? Mutual learning from exchanging experiences
Research Data Alliance will benefit:
? Connecting with other initiatives. IGAD as an RDA focal point for food and agricultural sciences
guarantees a connection with existing, relevant communities in other initiatives. IGAD can ensure
knowledge sharing and promotion of RDA recommendations outside of the RDA network, important for
the RDA as this expands awareness and possible adoption of RDA recommendations.
? Minimizing the TABÕs work. As with the old and current Working Groups under the IGAD umbrella, IGAD
has played a key role to assure the correct RDA development processes, to address issues and to discuss
needs and requirements to effectively deliver their work. A set of tasks has been done by the IGAD chairs
before RDA TABs are contacted which has minimized the amount of work for them.
? Attracting new RDA members, particularly researchers and stakeholders from low and
medium-income countries. Due to the characteristics of the food and agricultural sciences which are
multilingual and extremely global, the approach that IGAD has taken since the earliest days focused on
attracting researchers and stakeholders from low and medium-income countries using an inclusive
strategy. Just as an example, during the last IGAD online meeting in 2020, up to half of the attendants
and a good number of speakers were from low- and medium-income countries.
? Promoting the adoption of RDA outputs by the agricultural community. One important topic that has
been promoted during the IGAD Meetings is the adoption of RDA outputs by the food and agricultural
community. Some experiences have been documented and shared within the community.
5. Engagement with existing work in the area: A specific description, with tangible outputs and metrics, of the
planned dissemination and communication, outreach and engagement, incentivisation, endorsement and
adoption activities.
A brief review of related work and plan for engagement with any other existing RDA groups;
In 2019, a study was carried out to identify areas of interest of the IGAD members based on the existing subscriptions to
other IGs and WGs within RDA (See Figure 1). This analysis was used to establish synergies based on the priorities within
IGAD, and this was reflected in the 1st IGAD Annual Week in April 2020, inviting other RDA groups to join and present their
current activities. There are plans to revise and update this analysis periodically, in order to identify areas of common
interest with other RDA groups and draw up collaborative agendas for mutual benefit.
Figure 1. IGs and WGs that are of interest to the IGAD Community Members
IGAD is always willing to collaborate with other groups with common goals. One identified IG that shares common interests
is the RDA for the Sustainable Development Goals IG.
Eventual new IGs and/or WGs to be proposed directly by the CoP;
At this time, the CoP is able to announce the proposal of the new ÔCrop Data InteroperabilityÕ Working Group, which is
already being discussed within the IGAD community. Other IGs or WGs are expected to be announced in the future.
Interaction with key stakeholder organisations within the proposed discipline / research domain; Description of the CoPÕs
planned approach to engage with their discipline / research domain and its key stakeholder organisations and planned
approach to encourage broader community engagement and participation, including proposed ambassadors.
We are inviting first our known networks to collaborate as partners in the CoP, then we will learn from members what other
regional or subdomain networks we should reach out to for participation. Each network will have a key point of contact,
which we could call an ambassador, and they serve as liaison with their communities. Initial networks include:
? CGIAR
? Global Open Data in Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN)
? AgGateway
? International Society of Precision Agriculture (ISPA)
? Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)
? GO FAIR Food System and Regional Go-Fair Agro Implementation Networks
Outline of proposed collaboration and partnerships with industry, associations, organisations and media as well as
discipline/domain-specific funding opportunities.
See below.
6. Outcomes: Outline what the CoP intends to accomplish and how it plans to measure achievement. Include
examples of WG topics or supporting IG-level outputs that might lead to spin off IGs and/or WGs later on.
IGAD has successfully delivered outcomes in the past and it is planning to continue doing so. One of the main priorities is
to establish a robust network of non-RDA CoPs to enhance the outreach of RDA deliverables. In other communities, see
section on Interaction with key stakeholder organisations ... Any measure of success becomes a challenge, since indicators
like increasing the number of participants in IGAD or number of participants in online knowledge sharing activities might
not be considered as impact indicators. However, they are relevant for a day-to-day evaluation of the success of IGAD within
RDA. Additionally, it is expected to increase participation in events organized by non-RDA communities.
Adoption Plans (optional): If applicable, please provide specific plans for adoption or implementation of RDA outcomes
within the organizations and institutions represented by CoP members, as well as plans for adoption more broadly within
the community.
N/A
Operational Mechanisms:
Leadership: Describe how the CoP will be managed, how often it will meet and how it will maintain momentum between
Plenaries. Include details on how the CoP will develop consensus, address conflicts, stay on track and within scope, and
move forward during operation.
A team of at least three co-leads, drawn from different geographic regions, will meet regularly (e.g. weekly or co-weekly) to
plan, operate by consensus at leadership level.
CoP: Provide a description of the CoPÕs mode and frequency of operation (e.g. on-line and/or on-site, how frequently will
the group meet, be updated, etc.).
Offer engagement opportunities for CoP membership between in-person or virtual RDA meetings, a longer event (e.g.
weeklong virtual session) and/or webinar series to happen at least annually. A communication plan will be developed to
determine more regular opportunities to update the community.
IGAD promotes a continuous learning environment through periodic activities such as webinars. IGAD coffee breaks, for
instance, is a new kind of webinar series to support the exchange of experiences within IGAD and beyond. It consists of
virtual 15-minute presentations on the following topics of interest to the IGAD community, followed by 15 minutes of
discussion and the session is recorded for those who cannot attend.
Timeline: Describe draft milestones and goals for the first 18 months, including the mandatory Public report to be
submitted to Council for review every 18 months.
? Organize sessions for plenary (2 a year)
? Organize the IGAD Annual Week (either April or September, once a year)
? Develop communication plan based on capacity development and knowledge sharing activities
? Objective: Facilitate knowledge sharing to understand the gaps and stimulate the discussion and
developments
? Ensure global south participation
? Survey to assist any newcomers to RDA to identify any who may onboard to IGAD
? to be a focal point and find out what people want
? to actively invite to follow up with them proactively
? Introductory sessions to explain how RDA works
? Prepare a video to promote the CoP
? Submit Review (Public Report) to Council after 18 months"
Discipline-specific Guidance for Data Management Plans WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/discipline-specific-guidance-data-management-plans-wg,yes,"Introduction
Data management plans (DMPs) serve as the first step in the RDM lifecycle. They aid in recording metadata at various levels during the data description process and are intended to be adapted as a project evolves. During consultations and training focused on the concept of a data management plan, it becomes clear that the views of research funders and researchers differ widely on the use of DMPs. Research funders want to know what happens to the data during and after the project. Researchers, on the other hand, want support in their daily work with data and tend to see the DMP as an additional bureaucratic burden. Additionally, creating DMPs is further complicated because individual disciplines may have very different requirements and challenges for data collection and data management.
How can this discrepancy be overcome and researchers be supported?
Discipline specific information about research data management is one strategy to improve engagement from researchers in writing DMPs as well as researchers gaining more value from those DMPs. Many researchers have discipline-specific research support advisors, such as faculty- or project-embedded data stewards, who can comment on their DMPs, but discipline-specific support from the get-go would facilitate this process.
It would be advantageous for researchers if these requirements and the discipline-specific contents are reflected in the DMP because this would not only support the researchers in filling out the DMPs, but it will also help increase integration of DMPs into researchersÕ daily work.
While one option will be to create discipline-specific DMP templates, this could lead to problems with research funders who require a specific type of template from researchers as well as add to the complexity of projects working towards machine actionable DMPs and common standards for DMPs. Similarly, discipline-specific templates would be problematic for multidisciplinary projects.Therefore, discipline-specific guidance for each question in most DMP templates needs to meet researcher, funder and interoperability needs. The information in this guidance document can then be incorporated into existing templates - and guidance documents can be consulted in tandem for multidisciplinary projects.
The following disciplines were selected by the WG as examples to further demonstrate the discipline- and sub-discipline specific data management requirements of the research community.
Behavioural, Educational and Social Sciences
Nature of research: Behavioural, Educational and Social Sciences (BESS) consist of a wide range of sub-disciplines with RDM needs that overlap in some respects and are highly diverse in others. In general terms, BESS research consists of quantitative data, often in the form of questionnaires, qualitative data, generally in the form of text and audiovisual data, and physical data, which range from human tissues to archeological findings to paper documents. The more specific the sub-discipline, the greater the variation: for example, within the behavioural sciences, data such as neuroimages and experimental data on cognitive function are also collected. Additionally, many BESS researchers utilize GIS and other location-based data, as well as data gleaned from social media.
Use of DMPs: In general, DMPs are often treated as an administrative exercise in BESS research; something that must be completed for the purposes of a research grant, but which otherwise is not very useful for guiding day-to-day research activities. If there is not a requirement to complete DMPs for funding, it may not be completed at all.
RDM best practices and metadata standards: BESS research has an overarching RDM framework in the form of the CESSDA Data Management Expert Guide1; this guide provides a lot of useful insight and best practices for RDM in Social Sciences in general, particularly with regards to the management of qualitative data and questionnaire data.
The Data Documentation Initiative (DDI)2 is the main metadata standard for Social Sciences.
Challenges and considerations: The diversity of the various sub-disciplines within BESS research is a major challenge, due to the wide variety of data that may be collected under the BESS banner. The diversity of BESS research means that multiple metadata standards may be required, but at the moment there is a lack of awareness within the overall BESS community about metadata, ontologies and data documentation. BESS researchers may benefit from explanations on how to apply metadata, ontologies and documentation in a language that is applicable to their practice. Advice on how to apply specific metadata standards would also assist BESS researchers because the learning curve for applying these can be quite steep. Other challenges faced in the BESS discipline include: 1) a lack of awareness of good data management from an early stage. Without a good description of data collection in a DMP, BESS researchers often underestimate how their data collection methods may impact the quality of their data; 2) research on vulnerable populations. Much of BESS research has both privacy and ethical concerns that need to be addressed. This means there is an extra burden of managing physical consent forms and sensitive data. BESS researchers also require support on how to properly share these data with others; 3) wide variation in terms of digital competencies. Some BESS researchers have data science skills, while others feel more comfortable with pen and paper or the GUIs of Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Ensuring that data are reusable means improving upon the digital competencies of all BESS researchers. Ultimately, BESS researchers are a highly diverse group with varying needs that often overlap with other disciplines. They require guidance on DMPs in a way that is applicable to their work so that they can see the benefit of RDM in their day-to-day tasks.
Engineering and Natural Sciences
Nature of research: The engineering and natural sciences are very broad disciplines. Data is generated during experiments or simulations and sometimes the developed software itself is the research data. Due to the overlap between engineering and natural sciences with many other disciplines like medicine, humanities etc, many different types of data are created and these require different research data management practices to be followed. This results in many different challenges.
Use of DMPs: Currently, the use of DMPs is not widespread in the engineering and natural sciences. DMPs are mostly known through publicly funded projects and the advantages of DMPs are not yet widely known within the community. During a project in the framework of Òscience in the digital change.Ó3 on DMP in mechanical engineering at RWTH Aachen University and TU Darmstadt in 2018, engineers asked themselves while filling in a DMP: How relevant is that for me?. The RDM support raised the question: How can we make it understandable for engineers? The results showed that the current DMP templates have hardly been adapted for these fields and the questions are too general. This in turn means that researchers in these fields are not convinced about the usefulness of DMPs.
RDM best practices and metadata standards: There are hardly any best practices with regard to RDM in engineering and natural science. Researchers or individual sub-disciplines deal with RDM

topics independently, like data annotation in Wind Energy goes FAIR4. Another initiative is the Metadata4Ing group5 (special interest group of the NFDI4Ing6), which is working on a metadata schema for the engineering sciences, initially, for individual sub-disciplines. These RDM practices are not widespread. Having discipline specific DMPs will help researchers better evaluate which communities should collaborate in developing metadata standards for their field.
Challenges and considerations: Due to this broad spectrum of subdisciplines, the heterogeneity of the data is very high - from large data sets and confidential data to data in proprietary formats. Engineering sciences research often relies on industrial funding. This is accompanied by non-disclosure agreements, IP considerations and patent applications. Data storage only at the home institution (data silos) and restricted data sharing, where only the partners have access to the research data is fairly common. A discipline specific DMP would also provide input towards what should belong to the RDM best practices, specifically in engineering areas where things like metadata standards are almost non-existent. There is value in having researchers in these fields engage with the idea of dual use (particularly through the dmp) to ensure that implications of data sharing are well thought out -- and balanced appropriately.
Life Sciences - Medicine and Biology
Nature of research: The biological life sciences as a whole are extremely diverse in the activities and focus of research studies. Research studies can range from natural history studies documenting the occurrence of species in a laboratory notebook to basic science examining the origin of a new species using molecular biology to applied science examining the physiological processes involved in a viral infection using clinical trials where it overlaps with medicine. More specifically, in the medical sub-discipline of the life sciences, the data collected includes patient data which has specific data management needs and considerations. Additionally, the size of data collected can vary drastically across the life sciences ranging from small experimentally constrained studies of behavior to full genome sequencing of multiple species, not to mention full human genome sequences that might become more common as patient records in the future.
Use of DMPs: Across the globe, numerous funding bodies provide funds for research into Life Sciences and require DMPs including National Science Foundation7 (NSF), National Institute of Health8 (NIH), Wellcome9, etc. Mostly DMPs are seen as mandatory administrative documents to be submitted to funding bodies and do not address disciplinary specific practices.
RDM best practices and metadata standards: Many researchers in these areas have already adopted some RDM strategies and are actively sharing data to comply with funding and publishing requirements, however, this data is often not documented for re-use across the entire discipline. Additionally, many different metadata standards exist depending on the type of data being collected. For instance, OME-XML - Open Microscopy Environment XML (used for biological light microscopy data), Protocol Data Element Definitions (used by NIH for Clinical Trials registration), SRA Metadata (used for sequencing libraries, preparation techniques, and datafiles).

Challenges and considerations: Documentation can be difficult because of the siloed nature of sub-disciplines. Each sub-discipline varies with regards to the requirements for data management, the presence or absence of standards, and the culture of data sharing for reuse. Guidance around common data management techniques which could be adopted across sub-disciplines in the life sciences is vital for inter-sub-disciplinary re-use.
Many of the sub-disciplines across the life sciences are trying to collaborate or conduct meta-analyses of data collected across these sub-disciplines in attempts to solve large issues such as climate change, however, they are not often utilizing common metadata or documentation standards.
The specific care and legal requirements that need to be followed when handling patient data also adds to the complexity in terms of documentation. Sharing of medical records especially if in an anonymous form can be done efficiently only if common metadata standards are adopted.10
While we have covered several disciplines here the list of research fields that can benefit from discipline specific guidelines for their DMPs is much longer. Part of the effort in proposing this WG is to generate interest among researchers and research support members to identify if their fields would benefit from this.
Value Proposition
The working group will produce the Discipline-Specific Guidance Catalogues, which can provide a variety of stakeholders with disciplinary-specific guidance in the creation of data management plans. The key beneficiaries will be researchers from the involved disciplines as well as all stakeholders who work closely with researchers. These can be data stewards, data managers, research data librarians, research data management experts/ officers, etc. Similarly, the respective and related communities and associations may be interested in pushing forward the discipline-specific sections to help the researchers overcome the bureaucratic hurdle and perceive the DMP as a complementary and helpful tool for research.
The acceptable mode which has the greatest benefit for each discipline will become apparent during the work of the WG.
Benefits to stakeholders and disciplines
For researchers, having guidance specific for their discipline would help fill in the gap between a generic DMP and their daily practice. RDM comes in so many different flavors for different disciplines and best practices for each discipline can only be best practices if they are fine-tuned according to the needs of each specific discipline and known to practitioners in the discipline. Thus, providing discipline specific guidance for DMPs that are directly relevant to researchersÕ specific disciplines can make DMPs living tools that researchers can actively use. WhatÕs more, discipline specific guides can be used in conjunction to transcend individual disciplines and contribute to DMPs for multidisciplinary projects.
Often data stewards, data managers, research data librarians, research data management experts/ officers, research software engineers and others supporting researchers are hired centrally and there is simply not enough capacity to provide in-depth discipline specific support. Therefore, these professionals would greatly benefit from having readily available the Discipline-Specific Guidance Catalogues that they can share with the researchers. Additionally, the Discipline-Specific Guidance Catalogues could be used as a training tool for individuals newly hired into these types of positions.
Many research funders, universities and non-university institutions, as well as publishers expect some type of information about data management and/or accessibility from researchers. Depending on the funding agency, university, etc., this information can be provided in various forms - from a well-structured DMP to non-structured, individual information in a continuous text. Numerous institutions are
10 https://www.health-ri.nl/initiatives/personal-health-train
realizing the importance of hiring dedicated RDM support professionals as well as establishing institutional RDM policies. Yet, most institutions are still in the early days and are only able to provide central and rather generic support instead of disciplinary support. Additionally, it is a challenge to find data support professionals with disciplinary specific knowledge. Discipline-specific guidance can allow institutions to provide more tailored support to researchers, resulting in a better return on their investments. Therefore, institutions would also benefit from their data support professionals having access to Discipline-Specific Guidance Catalogues.
An increasing number of funders are mandating delivery of DMPs, as they endorse open science and FAIR data principles. If researchers have resources available to them explaining the disciplinary best practices, such as the Discipline-Specific Guidance Catalogues, they can more efficiently apply open science and FAIR data principles in their daily practice.
Researchers are often looking for guidance on what specifically to include in their DMPs. In response, researchers are often directed to use DMP tools which allow researchers to build DMPs following funder-specific structure and section-specific guidance. However, this guidance is often subject agnostic, thus leading to DMPs that may be well written and meet the funding agencies requirements, but are not actually applicable to a researcherÕs project, as it is missing specific, contextual information. The guidance of DMP tools, such as DMP Online, DMP Tool or RDMO., could be improved if information from the Discipline-Specific Guidance Catalogues is incorporated. Here, however, it must be further clarified in detail how exactly the discipline-specific adaptation can be implemented. Possibilities are the adaptation of questions, answers and/ or help texts in these tools. If no adaptation is possible, a separate sheet will be developed for the respective disciplines and solutions will be sought. For this form of a Discipline-Specific Guidance Catalogue it must then be checked whether it can be implemented in the respective tools or if the guidance can be distributed to the researchers in other ways, such as consultation with RDM experts/ officers. The Discipline-Specific Guidance Catalogues will also be available for download on discipline and RDM relevant websites.
In some research fields such as engineering sciences, industry partners are of great importance. In these cases, documentation plays a very important role, such as the non-disclosure agreements at the beginning. A discipline-specific DMP can include the non-disclosure agreements and supplement them over time.
Discipline-specific guidance for data management is valuable to publishers who support open data sharing through data accessibility requirements and policies. With this guidance, publishers can determine if there are discipline specific requirements and/or repositories best suited for the types of data that commonly are associated with articles in their journal. If there are, publishers can provide these best practices and guidance to publishing authors which could ultimately lead to increased discoverability of data associated with published articles and interoperability between datasets.
Repository curators frequently receive poorly curated data in self-deposit repositories. This poorly curated data stems from a lack of researcher training and discipline specific guidance that can be directly applied. The Discipline-Specific Guidance Catalogues could providing researchers with discipline-specific management practices which would ultimately improve the curation of their data through engaged data management planning and actions.
Engagement with existing work in this area In addition to the Active Data Management Plans IG, there are at the moment two WGs (Exposing Data Management Plans WG and DMP Common Standard WG) focusing on the topic of DMPs. The work of this proposed WG will complement their work and bring in the perspective of researchers.
In connection with the RDA, there are also GoFAIR groups that need to be taken into consideration for working together. For example, the FAIR Implementation Profiles (FIP) should be mentioned, where Krsitina Hettne has offered herself as a liasion. Many thanks.
Further, there is some evidence that supports researchersÕ need for subject-specific support for DMPs and the helpful nature of such tools. For instance, in engineering, at RWTH Aachen University and the Technical University of Darmstadt, a project was carried out in 2018/19 in the framework of Òscience in the digital change.Ó11 Together with engineers, a first draft of a DMP template for engineering science was developed. In workshops and world cafes engineers could evaluate, add, and delete help texts, questions, and answers based on the Research Data Management Organiser DMP template12. The results of the project were already presented in Helsinki at P14 in the Research Data Management in Engineering IG. Further considerations were also made during the session in a focus group. In a subsequent telephone conference, it was then considered that it would be useful to discuss these considerations with several sciences simultaneously and in a greater context.
A further approach are the Domain Data Protocols for empirical educational research13. These protocols describe concretely and with reference to the specific data type all relevant aspects of research data management with regard to data quality, data preparation, data documentation, work organisation, handling of legal requirements as well as FAIR principles.
The approach presented here represents a different type of data management plan and is specifically adapted to the particular needs of the discipline.
In addition to these examples, the WG would like to mention the example of psychology. The tool DataWiz was developed for this special field, which is an open source assistance system for data management in psychology
The support and benefits for researchers could be expanded through the expertise present at RDA. Therefore, it is important to involve the discipline specific RDA groups like Health Data IG, Social Science Research Data IG and Biodiversity Data Integration IG in conducting this work.
Working plan
The WG will provide Discipline-Specific Guidance Catalogues for the above mentioned disciplines. On the one hand, these catalogues will reflect the current situation in the respective discipline and take into account topics like FAIR and Open Data. From our experience in consulting and training, we find that discipline-specific advice is often already being applied for supporting researchers. However, the lack of a guiding framework on this advice could lead to inconsistencies between researchers or uncertainty for how discipline-specific data stewards should best advise their researchers. This WG will therefore help to address this and create a framework to support both researchers and discipline-specific data stewards in writing DMPs.

The Guidance for creating DMP questions from the Science Europe Practice Guide14 to the International Alignment of Data Management will be used as a basis upon which the discipline-specific guidance will be developed.
Milestones and Deliverable
M1: Identification of What is Already Known, Knowledge Gaps, Overlaps and Additional Use Cases (0 - 6 months)
To provide comprehensive discipline-specific guidance on DMPs, an initial survey of the current state of disciplinary-specific DMPs is required. Furthermore, it may be beneficial to determine if additional use cases for other disciplines should be included in the discipline-specific guidance. The survey will cover the current state of disciplinary-specific DMPs, knowledge or service gaps, overlaps between disciplines, possible use cases, and methods of presenting discipline-specific guidance in a final deliverable.
This information will be collected through the following instruments:
1. Online survey filled in by researchers and discipline-specific data stewards
2. At the end of the survey, participants can provide further contact information for phone or email interviews
The online survey will be distributed via major RDM mailing lists. WG members will also coordinate with any RDM Community Managers they know to share the survey with as many researchers and discipline-specific data stewards as possible. The online survey will also be discussed at RDA P16, where a BoF and group discussions will provide further insight on this topic.
M2: Discussions with disciplinary experts (6 - 10 months)
In order to create guidance that is based on disciplinary-specific requirements, members of the WG will reach out to disciplinary researchers and discipline-specific data stewards to facilitate in-depth discussions of DMPs. These experts will be approached directly, either online or in person during workshops or RDA plenaries, with the assistance of RDM community managers, or as follow-ups to the online survey. Using a semi-structured interview methodology, researchers and discipline-specific data stewards will be asked about their experience using DMPs and what attributes, functions, or features would be most useful to them. Additionally, discipline-specific data stewards will be asked how researchers in their discipline would benefit from tailored DMPs.
Examples for planned workshops:
? E-Science Days 2021: Workshop with researchers and infrastructure from different disciplines
? Q3 in 2021: Workshop for engineering-specific guidance for DMPs within the context of NFDI4Ing
? Penn State University Research Data Management Symposium: A component of this symposium will be a workshop with researchers from disciplines and research data support specialists to explore what type of guidance will be important and where disciplines overlap and differ in data management strategies.
In addition to Working Group sessions at the RDA Plenaries, we will organize open meetings for all Working Group members and any other interested individuals once in every two months starting from
14 https://scienceeurope.org/our-priorities/research-data/research-data-management/
17 February 2021. We will facilitate connections with DMP-related as well as discipline-specific groups within and beyond RDA by co-hosting these meetings with groups. These meetings will be organized to address general as well as discipline specific actions, plans and goals of this Working Group.
Furthermore, plans and outputs will be shared in national and international meetings, workshops and conferences.
M3: Creation of guidance document (10 - 13 months)
Based on the results of M1 and M2, a final guidance document will be created. This will address any knowledge gaps that were mentioned in the online survey and in-person interviews, as well as summarize any guidance that overlaps across disciplines. The WG will run a sprint to address these issues with the assistance of research data management experts and researchers in all of the use-case disciplines identified.
M4: Dissemination and adoption of guidance document for test cases (13 - 18 months)
Once the final guidance documents are created, the WG will promote the documents to stakeholders through a variety of channels, such as social media or professional associations and conferences. As part of this promotion, the WG will encourage users to serve as test cases for the guidance. By obtaining feedback on the document, the WG can refine the guidance so that it is useful in a variety of situations and possibly uncover more potential use cases. These test cases may also be shared with stakeholders and potential guidance document users to promote the adoption of the guidance.
D1: Online Survey Overview (after 8 months)
The survey details, including questions used, methodology and the audience that was targeted will also be shared. This can act as a resource for the future when fields that have not been covered in this WG can use it to develop their own discipline specific guidelines.
D2: Discipline-specific Guidance Overview (after 18 months)
A document will be created that provides guidance for each use-case discipline for every DMP question addressed in Science Europe Practice Guide. This document will be shared with DMP software providers to utilize as they see fit. It will also be shared with funders who can opt to include the document with the other information provided to researchers creating DMPs using funder templates. Lastly, the WG will use their connections with RDM Community Managers to make sure that discipline-specific data stewards at research institutions are aware of the guidance document so that they can implement it in their daily work and refer to it as needed.
Currently, the Science Europe Practice Guide includes the following topics:
? Data description and collection or re-use of data
? Documentation and data quality
? Storage and back-up during research process
? Legal/ethical requirements, codes of conduct
? Data sharing and long-term preservation
? Data management responsibilities and resources
The Science Europe Practice Guide will be used as a basis for the Discipline-Specific Guidance Catalogues which will be expanded based on domain specific requirements and considerations. For instance, for engineering research, it would be necessary to strengthen the corresponding catalogue with guidance about Intellectual Property Rights, Data Transfer Agreements and Non Disclosure Agreements. Additionally, the Discipline-Specific Guidance Catalogues will expand on the differences
and similarities in legal, ethical, and practical implementation governed by GDPR requirements and data privacy among disciplines such as social and medical sciences .
Adoption plan/ Outcomes
Major/Preliminary outcomes of the WG will include the following:
? Results from landscape analysis
? A structured framework for developing disciplinary DMP guidelines
? Disciplinary guidance for:
? Behavioural, Education and Social Sciences
? Engineering and Natural Sciences,
? Life Sciences - Medicine and Biology
? Outreach and liaison with the DMP community via plenaries, particularly research groups and DMP tool providers
? Preliminary results from adoption cases and associated testing
As part of our adoption plans, we intend to work closely with the various tool providers, specifically RDM Organiser, DMPTool, DMPonline, Data Stewardship Wizard etc, to ensure the guidelines can be reused in these platforms. We have already solicited inputs from these groups to ensure participation. We have also liaised with the Active DMP Interest Group and will collaborate with them to ensure the successful"
Exposing Data Management Plans WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/exposing-data-management-plans-wg,yes,"A variety of stakeholders are showing growing interest in exposing data management plans (*) to other
actors (human/machine) in the research lifecycle, beyond their creator and the funder or institution
that mandates their production. Interested stakeholders include researchers themselves, funders,
institutions, and a variety of service providers and community organisations including repositories,
institutions, journals, publishers, and providers of tools for writing and maintaining plans.
Implementation and adoption is currently hampered by two problems:
? A lack of standards for expression and interchange of DMPs
? Insufficient understanding of the needs of users and the benefits and risks of different modes of
action
This proposed working group will address both of these issues; the issue of a standardised form of
expression for DMPs is the concern of the proposed DMP Common Standards Working Group. The
groupÕs output will include a reference model and alternative strategies for exposing plans, to best
serve community interests in meeting FAIR principles,1 based on shared experience of Ôearly adoptersÕ
in test implementations. It will be supported by work to gauge user needs and motivations for exposing
DMPs as well as perceived risks and benefits. Note * our main focus is on Data Management Plans
(DMPs) but we will seek examples of Software Management Plans (SMPs) where relevant to exposure
use cases of interest to the Active DMP Interest Group.
Value Proposition
The key beneficiaries of the WG outcomes will be stakeholders with a common interest in using Data or
Software Management Plans as instruments for demonstrating that research products have been

managed according to research community standards and generic principles (e.g. that the research
products should be FAIR), and that recognition is given for doing so.
There is potential value in exposing plans for a variety of stakeholders involved in their production and
consumption. These include researchers themselves, funders, institutions, and a variety of service
providers and community organisations including repositories, institutions, journals, publishers, and
providers of tools to help write and maintain plans. The WG will provide a Use Cases Catalogue to
describe implementation scenarios and articulate their benefits to researchers and other stakeholders,
with case studies of how those benefits have been realised. Through consultation with users of wellestablished
planning tools (DMPTool, DMPonline), the Use Cases Catalogue will also identify the degree
of acceptance among researchers for the levels of exposure/publication each use case entails, barriers
to realising the benefits, and any concerns about undesirable impacts.
Generalising from the scenarios and examples contained in the Use Cases Catalogue, the WG will
produce a Reference Model to document generic components and workflows for exposing plans (and
metadata about them), and offer recommendations for further action by each of the relevant
stakeholder groups . By gaining endorsements for the Reference Model from relevant stakeholders for
each use case we will provide a community endorsed approach to using plans to share demonstrable
advancement in data sharing practice.
As a starting point we identify below some of the potential benefits for each stakeholder group:
For researchers a public DMP may be seen as a new way to make their research more visible and
facilitate information exchange about best practices in data sharing. It may also evolve to become a
research output in its own right; a creditworthy claim that the research team has a novel or interesting
approach to data management (e.g. RIOjournal). This is analogous to publishing methods (e.g. Methods)
and other research outputs (e.g. Wellcome Open Research).
For researchers, data managers, research software engineers and others involved in delivering research
outputs the plan informs their work, reminding them where, when, and with whom to share those
outputs. Exposing plans more widely to project participants when active data management is underway
can better inform decision making (e.g. in labs) regarding how to manage the research project users &
groups, which storage to write to and when, which data elements to make public, with which licenses,
etc. Keeping the research project participants informed about the plan throughout the projectÕs
lifecycle will increase compliance, and allow project participants to note variance from any pre-award
plan.
As a record of such decision making, an actively updated DMP or SMP can improve the coordination and
in turn reproducibility of research by others. Participants who may not have authored the plan, or only
contribute to part of the project will especially benefit from easier access to plans, as will those who
may have joined the project part-way to completion. Finally, replication studies will be better informed
if the original plan is shared, and this plan has been actively updated to include a record of any variance
in context, along with the data or code underlying other published outputs. Integration of DMP/SMP
authoring tools with active data management platforms would help researchers to keep plans in step
with the actions they refer to, with the potential for automation. For example Los Alamos National
Laboratory is prototyping integration between DMPTool and Open Science Framework.2

For institutions when research teams share DMP content through Research Information Management
or CRIS systems, the information may be used by Research Offices and other institutional support
services to assess demand for RDM services, such as storage, preparation for deposit, quality control
mechanisms, or training. Some institutions have explored internal exchange of DMPs and related
metadata between DMP support tools (DMPTool, DMPonline) and other institutional systems such as
Current Research Information Systems and grants databases.3 More commonly, institutions have
encouraged sharing of example DMPs, to promote good practice in writing DMPs across the institution,
and help to meet demand for support in meeting fundersÕ expectations. Publishing DMPs from
successful bids may also demonstrate the institutionÕs role in meeting funder expectations. We can also
use the plan, at data storage or archiving, to determine if the metadata provided, and storage obtained
or requested, meet the requirements originally set out.
For data repositories DMP details shared in advance of data deposition help the repositoryÕs own
planning, and offer context and provenance information that may otherwise be difficult to retrace. For
example the UK Natural and Environmental Research Council requires researchers to submit an outline
DMP and, if their proposal is funded, provide a ÔfullÕ DMP in collaboration with the datacentre they
intend to submit data to.4 This illustrates that DMP publication may help the repository cross-link
between the research outputs it holds, and provide information that increases the potential for reuse.
For funders public DMPs may aid community scrutiny and knowledge-sharing, supplementing the
fundersÕ internal review and monitoring. A recent Open Review pilot by the European Commission
illustrates this.5 Longer-term impacts could include more efficient use of funding towards FAIR outputs.
For most funding bodies DMP are a relatively recent policy development, and so far there is little
published evidence of such impacts. Recently however OpenAire has carried out a survey to gather
feedback on the European CommissionÕs approach to DMPs and the FAIR DMP template in particular.6
For journals, a public DMP offers context information to aid peer review of any data underlying a
submitted article and therefore strengthen claims of transparency/reproducibility. In addition, DMPs
may be publishable as a description of data management aspects of interest to journal audiences. For
example DMPs are published by RIOjournal and BMC Research Notes, and International Journal of
Digital Curation is planning to do so.
For publishers and funders, a published plan may also offer a similar role to a data article, providing a
project-level view of data or software produced in research, and a record of how production has been
managed in accordance with policy expectations. A plan that records relationships between data, code
and other outputs can provide the funder and publisher with a means to more efficiently and effectively
link up these research products, helping funders to track their investments and publishers to maintain
the research record. For example the US Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance (IEDA) provides tools to
link DMPs with data submissions, via information on the relevant National Science Foundation award.7,
8 There is also strong interest from the Wellcome Trust in the potential to link plans to the resulting
outputs, and in exposing plans to help enhance discoverability, as well as for the basis of compliance

checking. Wellcome has also recently moved from requesting DMPs to asking for more holistic outputs
management plans (covering data, software, materials and IP).9
For Research Data Management service providers, public machine-readable plans can be used as a
basis for added-value services that link research to outputs throughout the research lifecycle, and help
maintain the integrity of the research record. Such services could include, for example, accumulating
information about the actual data location, its characteristics and provenance for further automatic
tracking, including data reuse or disposal. There are also opportunities to make plans interactive by
linking DMP support tools to other tools and platforms offering guidance ÔwizardsÕ 10 and training layers
to ensure that relevant advice and services are brought to the attention of researchers from the
beginning of their project.
Finally, as DMPs are Òbecoming the main tool to enforce policies on research data managementÓ,11
collections of publicly accessible plans may become a research resource in their own right. This should
for example enable studies of the impact of policy changes on data management practice, and help
track disciplinary variations in practice that can inform research communities to establish ÔRDM
protocolsÕ that guide individual researchers in a given field.
Engagement with existing work in the area
The case statement builds on related work on machine-actionable DMPs, and on data publishing
workflows, and complements parallel efforts of other RDA groups, and elsewhere.
The statement also draws on use cases identified in the IDCC17 workshop report by Simms et al.12 That
report identifies 8 main use cases, each of which relies on some element of DMP exposure, and is based
on priorities identified by participants in this workshop and previous RDA discussions. We will further
define and expand on those use cases.
The Exposing DMPs WG directly complements the DMP Common Standards WG, which began itÕs work
from Plenary 10. The latter is developing a common data model and access mechanisms for machineactionable
DMPs, based on user stories defined through community consultation. The Exposing DMPs
WG couples their data-modelling approach with a research data management planning process-driven
one. By loosely coupling their activities, the Working Groups will aim to ensure their respective outputs
are compatible but may be used independently. This will be achieved by participating in the respective
WG meetings, collaborating closely, and using consistent terminology, e.g. for DMP content themes and
stakeholder groups .
Coordinated activities across the two working groups will include:
? Using relevant user stories collected by DMP Common Standards WG, i.e. where these imply
exposure of DMP content to other systems or actors, as a primary input to the use cases we
define. We will also propose further user stories to reflect any additional requirements arising
from community responses to the use cases.

? Referring to the DMP Common Standards data model as this develops, with particular
attention to events that create, read, update or delete DMP content in their model. As the
Exposing DMPs WG begins documenting use cases and workflows based on relevant case
studies it will provide the DMP Common Standards WG with information it may use to assess
the data model fitness for purpose, i.e. for embedding DMP content in existing workflows, and
for information exchange across research tools and systems to enable new workflows.
Where they involve exposing DMP content about the planned use of storage, we will adopt the
standard vocabulary that the Storage Service Definitions working group are developing, where
appropriate, to facilitate meaningful comparison of storage requirements across different DMPs.
The Exposing DMPs WG will fully articulate community requirements for DMP exposure, and
recommend actions that stakeholders can take to ensure that exposed/published DMPs provide
measurable benefits. The proposers are directly or indirectly involved in a number of other relevant
initiatives that will support that work, including the following:
? The Domain Repositories IG is establishing domain-level RDM protocols. These will be referred
to in our reference model, to ensure workflows and scenarios cover a range of disciplinary
exemplars
? The work is informed by previous work by the WDS/RDA Data Publishing Workflows WG to
produce a Reference Model for Data Publishing13, and guidelines for service providers
connecting repositories to workflows earlier in the research lifecycle. 14
? Liaison with the RDA/WDS Publishing Data IG, to ensure workflows for DMP publication follow
guidelines of the Scholarly Links Exchange (Scholix) to ensure DMPs and the research outputs
they refer to are cross-linked
? Liaison with the Data policy standardisation and implementation IG will ensure that any policy
recommendations are complementary, and avoid duplication of effort.
? The Storage Service Definitions WG proposes in its case statement (pending submission) to
define parameters for describing storage requirements in a manner that will allow better
allocation of resources to needs. This may inform our WGÕs service recommendation use case
for enabling storage requirements documented in a DMP to be automatically matched to
storage services. A case study on this topic will be sought from members of this WG and
coordinated through the DMP Common Standards WG, which has shared membership of both
groups.
In addition, we benefit from involvement of the group membership in the following: -
? Current joint work by the Digital Curation Centre (DCC) and University of California Curation
Center (UC3) outlined in the workshop report, towards gathering and responding to community
requirements in this area through their DMP support tools DMPtool and DMPonline.
? The FORCE11 working group on FAIR DMPs which is collating international activity in this area
(https://www.force11.org/group/fairdmp) and can ensure our work packages are
complementary.
? The recently formed Australian Data Management Planning IG and its sub-group on Machineactionable
DMPs.

The work will be informed by results from the recent survey by OpenAire about the Data Management
Plan template for the European CommissionÕs Horizon2020 programme, in particular the priorities
identified for additional functionality in associated DMP tools. 15
Work Plan
Encouraging early steps have been taken towards providing a spectrum of access modes to a DMP, from
partial exposure of plans and metadata through to publication. This case statement has set out some of
the potential reasons for exposing DMPs to wider access, interrogation and scrutiny. However, many
researchers view DMPs as an administrative burden. While there may be widespread support for the
view that DMPs offer researchers an opportunity to manage their data better, and offer various
professional groups an opportunity to help them do that, there is little evidence of who gains or is
adversely affected by DMP sharing and exposure along the way.
We believe there is widespread community interest in further reference information and guidance on
when and how data and software plans should be shared, in order to best serve community interests in
meeting FAIR data principles with least effort. At present the guidance is limited to that available from
plan authoring tools such as DMPonline and DMPTool. This Working Group aims to fill that gap by
delivering the following outputs:
Milestones and Deliverables
M1. Use Cases Consultation (Report and datasetÐ M6)
The only evidence of researchersÕ support for exposing DMPs is the fact that they do it. Many do so with
only minimal exposure, e.g. sharing DMPs with institutional support services in order to get advice. A
few do it with maximal exposure, using various routes to make their DMP public. Their reasons,
concerns and arguments for doing so (or not) have not so far been widely documented, and this
consultation aims to correct that.
The use cases consultation will provide an interim report describing feedback elicited on a range of
exposure scenarios, from the main stakeholders in Data Management Planning, identified as:
? User communities of DMP tools, including DMPOnline and DMPTool
? Researchers who prepare DMPs but do not currently use DMP tools
? Journals with an interest in data management, including IJDC, BMC Research Notes, Data
Science Journal
? Institutional research support groups, including Library, Research Services and IT Services
communities
? Funding bodies and data policy-makers including, Belmont Forum, Wellcome , Arnold, Open
Science Funders Forum, European Commission
The scenarios (8-10 in number) will range in degree of exposure from partial exposure of metadata to
full exposure of plans they are responsible for producing, or interested in accessing.

1. ÔDirect ÒLiveÓ DepositÕ Integration of DMP management tools (e.g. DMPonline16, DMPtool17
, RDM Organizer18) with active data management and sharing platforms (e.g. Open Science
Framework19 ), grant administration or Current Research Information Systems. Exposure in
this use case may be limited to that required for the research team and direct collaborators
to implement the plan and engage with their organisationÕs professional services.
2. ÕService RecommendationÕ; Users are offered further guidance on options available that
match their research context, funder requirements and/or data sharing policies of the top
journals in the field, from a broader range of services (e.g. cloud storage, data analysis) by
disclosing elements of their planning at whichever stage in their DMP/project lifecycle they
choose. As above, service recommendation might be performed within DMP management
tools, or via intermediary applications.
3. ÕDirect DepositÕ Integration of DMP management tools (e.g. DMPonline, DMPtool) with
journal and repository submission workflows, possibly via intermediary applications (e.g.
Data2Paper20). Users are offered guidance on options available that match their research
context, - these may consist of open source, academic and/or commercial tools and other
services - then taken through the submission and acceptance criteria, and can then submit
directly to their chosen outlet.
4. ÕDMP Paper-1Õ Submit a Data Management Plan as an article for publication. Similar in
concept to a data paper, the DMP paper briefly describes the research context for the DMP,
identifies aspects of the data management challenges of interest to the community, and
cites any dataset that is available.
5. ÔDMP Paper-2Õ As above, but the DMP itself is first submitted to a public repository and
then cited in the DMP Paper along with any relevant dataset, using a citation format similar
to that recommended by Force11 for datasets.
The scenarios we consult the community on will be informed by the DMP Common Standards WG
analysis of user stories resulting from their previous consultation (results of which will be available prior
to Plenary 11, March 2018)). This will inform an agreed set of up to 12 use cases.
The scenarios will also reference the use cases identified in the IDCC17 workshop report on MaDMP by
Simms et al. That report identifies 8 main use cases, each of which relies on some element of DMP
exposure, and is based on priorities identified by participants in this workshop and previous RDA
discussions.
The main instruments for gathering feedback on the use case scenarios will be: -
1) Online survey to elicit views on the benefits and risks of DMP exposure, and the relevance of the
planned WG outputs to stakeholder groups, targeting the following:
? Researchers who have submitted DMPs to a funder with the aid of DMPtool, DMPonline or
other tool for DMP authoring/ advice
16 DMPonline. https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/
17 DMPtool https://dmptool.org/
18 RDM Organizer. http://rdmorganiser.github.io/en/
19 Open Science Framework. https://osf.io/
20 Data2Paper. https://www.data2paper.org/
8
? Researchers who have submitted DMPs without the aid of any DMP tool
? Institutional RDM Service providers or other professional support services responsible for
providing localized advice on data or software management planning, including ÔadminÕ users in
institutions deploying DMPtool, DMPonline for their researchers
? Other service providers interested in provisioning in response to DMPs
? Members of the Active DMP Interest Group
2) Phone or email interviews with authors of data or software management plans that have been
made public through a journal, repository, website, or DMP authoring tool. Interviews will elicit
their more detailed responses on usage scenarios.
3) Phone or email interviews with data policy-makers in at least 4 funding bodies and 8 institutions
(spanning the US, UK, Europe, and Australasia) to elicit views on policy monitoring use cases, and
implications of DMP exposure,
4) Group discussion at RDA Plenary 11 and other relevant events ; with stakeholders including the
above; plus representatives of academic libraries, publishers, research infrastructures and other
groups providing advice or other services to support data and software management planning
Response data will be anonymized before sharing if required by respondents, and deposited in Zenodo
or another public repository. Interview data will also be deposited. The report will summarise
responses to consultation questions relating to each scenario.
D1. Use Case Catalogue and Case Studies (Report/ database M12)
The Use Cases Catalogue and Case Studies will describe our shared analysis of the consultation
responses, and provide a case study describing an implementation of each of the 8-10 use case
scenarios, where examples can be found While the consultation responses will describe the range of
sentiment, benefits and concerns identified by each stakeholder group involved in the use case, the
case studies will illustrate the planning lifecycle and relevant workflows used by adopters of pilots/early
implementations. Adopters will also be invited to describe the outcome of their planning in terms of
three main dimensions:
1. The extent to which the plan has been updated from an initial statement at the project application
stage through to formal reporting and publication of outputs
2. The extent to which the plan has been shared by its primary author (e.g. researcher or data
manager) with peer groups, institutional support services, domain-based support services, public
repositories, and journals
3. The extent to which the latest version of their plan has altered choices proposed in the initial version
The studies will consider how these dimensions have, from the plan authorsÕ perspective, shaped
subsequent choices of platforms and tools to conduct the research, and impacted on their projectÕs
ability to meet FAIR data management guidelines.
We will solicit the use cases from members of the Working Group, the Active DMP Interest Group,
known contacts and other contacts made through the use cases consultation. The approach taken is
based on the co-chairs experience in inviting the participants in a previous RDA/WDS Working Group on
Publishing Data Workflows to present a structured walk through of their processes, during RDA
plenaries and conference calls.
9
D2. Reference Model and Recommendations for Exposing Data and Software
Management plans (Report, M18)
A Reference Model will be produced to offer practical guidelines for institutions and service providers.
The model will illustrate how exposure helps researchers and others to use Data or Software
Management Plans as resources for better management, stewardship, and preservation, rather than as
a box-ticking exercise. Specific recommendations or guidelines will address aggregation of metadata
from plans to inform capacity planning, submission of plans to publishers, and the use of shared plans in
policy-making to evaluate how data policies impact on data management practice.
Drawing on the approach taken by the RDA/WDS Publishing Data Workflows WG, which produced a
Reference Model for Data Publishing, the Reference Model will describe the workflows needed to
connect the various components of plan exposure, and address versioning issues. The content will
initially be abstracted from the case studies describing the planning lifecycle and workflows used for
each of the use case scenarios.
The Reference Model will be platform agnostic, allowing for the possibility that alternative
combinations of components may be used (for example a DMP might be ÔpublishedÕ through alternative
routes). The model will assume that components interact through published APIs and open standards
(e.g. SWORD). As far as possible it will also use outputs of the DMP Common Standards WG as these
become available.
A set of recommendations for relevant stakeholder groups will be included in this final report, based on
the analysis of the consultation responses presented in the Use Cases Catalogue and Report, and
feedback from the Active DMP IG and broader RDA community on the earlier deliverable.
Working group operation, communication and engagement
The working group co-chairs will ensure the group operates by consensus. Where consensus cannot be
achieved decisions will be taken by majority decision of the group, or its co-chairs, and at all times
according to RDA principles of openness, balanced representation, technology neutrality, and
harmonization across communities and technologies.
The working group will meet on a monthly basis, online and at RDA Plenaries and other events,
including at the IDCC (International Digital Curation) conference in February 2017, 2018. Advance
notice of meeting arrangements will be circulated online to the groupÕs RDA mailing list, and meeting
notes will be circulated by the same route.
The co-chairs and members have access to a broad range of other means of communication that will be
used to engage with the broader community, initially to seek comments on the case statement. These
include websites, mailing lists and social media associated with DMP authoring tools, journals and
stakeholder organisations that have an international and multi-sector scope. Any results from
community interactions that occur via non-RDA media will be made available and regularly updated on
the Exposing DMPs group page.
10
Co-chairs will develop a detailed workplan with further milestones. This and all further discussion
documents and related material resulting from the groupÕs work will be posted in a file repository on
the RDA website, and made available under a CC-BY 4.0 licence."
dmp Common Standards WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/dmp-common-standards-wg,yes," 

The need for establishing this working group was articulated during the 9th plenary meeting in Barcelona during the Active DMPs IG session.  The discussion was framed by a white paper by Simms et al. on machine-actionable data management plans (DMPs). The white paper is based on outputs from the IDCC workshop held in Edinburgh in 2017 that gathered almost 50 participants from Africa, America, Australia, and Europe. It describes eight community use cases which articulate consensus about the need for a common standard for machine-actionable DMPs (where machine actionable is defined as Òinformation that is structured in a consistent way so that machines, or computers, can be programmed against the structureÓ)

 

The specific focus of this working group is on developing common information model and specifying access mechanisms that make DMPs machine-actionable. The outputs of this working group will help in making systems interoperable and will allow for automatic exchange, integration, and validation of information provided in DMPs, for example, by checking whether a provided PID links to an existing dataset, if hashes of files match to their provenance traces, or whether a license was specified. The common information models are NOT intended to be prescriptive templates or questionnaires, but to provide re-usable ways of representing machine-actionable information on themes covered by DMPs.

 

The vision that this working group will work to realise is one where DMPs are developed and maintained in such a way that they are fully integrated into the systems and workflows of the wider research data management environment. To achieve this vision we will develop a common data model with a core set of elements. Its modular design will allow customisations and extensions using existing standards and vocabularies to follow best practices developed in various research communities. We will provide reference implementations of the data model using popular formats, such as JSON, XML, RDF, etc.  This will enable tools and systems involved in processing research data to read and write information to/from DMPs. For example, a workflow engine can add provenance information to the DMP, a file format characterization tool can supplement it with identified file formats, and a repository system can automatically pick suitable content types for submission and later automatically identify applicable preservation strategies.

 

The deliverables will be publicly available under CC0 license and will consist of models, software, and documentation. The documentation will describe functionality and semantics of terms used, rationale, standard compliant ways for customisation, and requirements for supporting systems to fully utilise the capabilities of the developed model.

 

The working group will be open to everyone and will involve all stakeholders representing the whole spectrum of entities involved in research data management, such as: researchers, tool providers, infrastructure operators, repository staff and managers, software developers, funders, policy makers, and research facilitators. We will take into account requirements of each group.This will likely speed up and increase adoption of the working group outcomes.

 

The group will predominantly collaborate online, but will use any possibility to meet in person during RDA plenaries, conferences, workshops, hackathons or other events in which their members participate. All meetings in which decisions are made will be documented and their summaries will be circulated using the RDA website.

 

The work will be performed iteratively and incrementally following the best practices from system and software engineering. We will evaluate preliminary drafts of the model with community to receive early feedback and to ensure that the developed common model is interoperable and exchangeable across implementations. We will also express existing DMPs using the developed common model and will investigate how to support modification of machine actionable DMPs by various tools involved in data management process, while ensuring that proper provenance and versioning information is stored with. Finally, we will build prototypes to investigate possible system integrations and to evaluate to which degree the information contained in the DMPs can be automatically validated and which actions or alerts depending on a DMP state can be triggered, e.g. by sending notifications to repositories or funder systems.

 

During our work we will monitor parallel efforts and engage with various research communities to find candidates for pilot studies and to transfer the acquired know-how. Towards the end of the lifetime of the working group we will launch pilot projects in which the model will be customised to suit the needs of the identified interested communities. Pilot studies will use the models to integrate systems and demonstrate how machine-actionable DMPs can work.

 

We believe that the outcomes delivered by this group will contribute to improving the quality of research data and research reproducibility, while at the same time reducing the administrative burden for researchers and systems administrators.

 

Value Proposition: A specific description of who will benefit from the adoption or implementation of the WG outcomes and what tangible impacts should result.

 

A common data model for machine-actionable DMPs will enable interoperability of systems and will facilitate automation of data collection and validation processes. The common model and accompanying interfaces and libraries are an essential building block for the infrastructure. Although for some stakeholder groups, the developments will be invisible (and should be) so that the unification and standardisation of a DMP model will bring benefits to all of them.

    Researchers will benefit from having fewer administrative procedures to follow.  Machine-actionable DMPs can facilitate the automatic collection of  metadata about experiments. They will accompany experiments from the beginning and will be updated over the course of the project. Consecutive tools used during processing can read and write data from machine-actionable DMPs. As a result, parts of the DMPs can be automatically generated and shared with other collaborators or funders. Furthermore, researchers whose data is reused in other experiments will gain recognition and credit because their data can be located, reused, and cited more easily.

    Reusing parties will gain trust and confidence that they can build on othersÕ previous work because of a higher granularity of available information.

    Funders and repositories will be able to automatically validate DMPs.  For example, they will be able to check whether the specified ORCID iD or e-mail are correct, whether the data is available at the specified repository, and whether the data checksums are correct Ð in other words, whether the information provided in a DMP reflects reality.

    Infrastructure providers will get a universal format for exchange of (meta-) data between the systems involved in data processing and data storage. They could also be able to automate processes associated to DMPs, like backup, storage provision, grant access permissions, etc.

    Society will be better able to safeguard investment made in research and will gain assurance that scientific findings are trustworthy and reproducible, while the underlying data is available and properly preserved.  "
Wheat Data Interoperability WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/wheat-data-interoperability-wg.html,yes,"Wheat intiative: www.wheatinitiative.org The Wheat Initiative aims to reinforce synergies between bread and durum wheat national and international research programmes to increase food security, nutritional value and safety while taking into account societal demands for sustainable and resilient agricultural production systems.
Main goals :
?	coordinate worldwide research efforts in the fields of wheat genetics, genomics, physiology, breeding and agronomy.
?	provide a forum to facilitate communication between research groups and organisations worldwide.
?	foster communication between the research community, funders and global policy makers at the international level to meet their research and development goals.
?	facilitate and ensure the rapid exchange of information and know-how among researchers, and support knowledge transfer to breeders and farmers

G8+5 open data for agriculture: At the 2012 G-8 Summit, G-8 leaders committed to the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition, the next phase of a shared commitment to achieving global food security.

As part of this commitment, they agreed to Òshare relevant agricultural data available from G-8 countries with African partners and convene an international conference on Open Data for Agriculture, to develop options for the establishment of a global platform to make reliable agricultural and related information available to African farmers, researchers and policymakers, taking into account existing agricultural data systems.Ó

?	Charter: Interoperability is a wide concept that encompasses the ability of organisations to work together towards mutually beneficial and commonly agreed goals. The Working group is using the following definition from the EIF:  ÔAn interoperability framework is an agreed approach to interoperability for organisations that wish to work together towards the joint delivery of public services. Within its scope of applicability, it specifies a set of common elements such as vocabulary, concepts, principles, policies, guidelines, recommendations, standards, specifications and practices.Õ
The working group aims to provide a common framework for describing, representing linking and publishing Wheat data with respect to open standards. Such a framework will promote and sustain Wheat data sharing, reusability and operability. Specifying the Wheat linked data framework will come with many questions: which (minimal) metadata to describe which type of data? Which vocabularies/ontologies/formats? Which good practices?  
Mainly based on the the needs of the Wheat initiatiative Information System (WheatIS) in terms of functionalities and data types, the working group will identify relevant use cases in order to produce a  ÒcookbookÓ on how to produce Òwheat dataÓ that are easily shareable, reusable and interoperable.To do so, the working group will :
?	Run a survey of existing standards and recommendations (vocabularies, ontologies, formats): this survey will identify which standards are adopted in the Wheat data managers community, which ones are missing and which ones can stand as references.
?	Coordinate data exchanges : identify the main Wheat data types, end-user categories, case studies and provide standards harmonization, guidelines to describe, document, structure and interlink data taking into account the diversity of data types.
?	Evaluate the interest of linked data technologies to improve usage and access to the information.
?	Identify relevant platforms to support the Wheat linked data framework.
Based on a survey report  performed in June 2012, the Working group will focus on the following data types, by order of priority: SNP, Genomic annotations, Phenotypes, Genetic Maps, Physical Maps, Germplasm.
Implementing the framework will help cultivate a Wheat  ecosystem with people familiar with interoperability, organisations ready to collaborate, and common tools and services. 

Value proposition
?	Individuals, communities, and initiatives that will benefit from the Wheat Data Interoperability Guidelines
The WheatIS will be provided with a linked data framework based on community-accepted standards, which ensure data analysis and data integration facilities. Such a framework is a great asset for the WheatIS to provide the analysis functions and other services expected by the researchers.
?	The Wheat data managers and data scientists will have a common and global framework to describe, document, and structure their data.
?	Researchers, growers, breeders, and other data users will have seamless access, use, and reuse to a wide range of Wheat data. Data linking will also ease emergence of new data analyses and knowledge discovery methodologies.
?	Other plants data managers and scientists Ð will have the benefit of a reusable data framework. 
?	Researchers working on other plants will be able to more easily access, reuse and link up Wheat data with their own data.
The ÒcookbookÓ might be adapted for other crops such as RICE, MAIZE which are also very important for food security

?	Key impacts of the RDA Wheat Data Interoperability Guidelines
?	Promote adoption of common standards, vocabularies and best practices for Wheat data management
?	Facilitate access, discovery and reuse of Wheat data
?	Facilitate Wheat data integration

Engagement with existing work in the area
The Wheat data interoperability WG is a working group of the RDA Agricultural data interest group.
The working group will take advantage of other RDAÕs working groupÕs production. In particular, the working group will be watchful of working groups concerned with metadata, data harmonization and data publishing.
The working group will also interact with the WheatIS experts and other plant projects such as TransPLANT (http://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Projects/TransPLANT), agINFRA (http://www.aginfra.eu) which are built on standard technologies for data exchange and representation.
The Wheat data interoperability group will exploit existing collaboration mechanisms like CIARD (http://www.ciard.net) to get as much as possible stakeholder involvement in the work.

Adoption plan
The working group can rely on its initial members to promote a large adoption of the data framework. Indeed:
?	INRA is a leading partner of the Wheat initiative and an active member of the working group. One of the Wheat initiative objectives is to build an international and  integrated Wheat information system (WheatIS) intended to an international Wheat community (researchers, growers, breeders, etc.). The WheatIS could operate as a hub and integrate wheat data produced by the community. The working group will base a large part of its specification requirements on the Wheat initiativeÕs data exchange needs, and the WheatIS experts will be part of the working group stakeholders. The Wheat linked data framework will be tested first through the WheatIS. The working group can rely both on the Wheat initiative members (public research organizations and private companies)  and its community to ensure a large circulation of the Wheat linked data framework and facilitate its adoption.
?	Achieving food security for all is at the heart of FAO's efforts Ð to make sure people have regular access to enough high-quality food to lead active, healthy lives. FAOÕs mandate is to improve nutrition, increase agricultural productivity, raise the standard of living in rural populations and contribute to global economic growth.   One of FAOÕs principal means to achieve this goal is collecting, disseminating and brokering knowledge.  Therefore FAO has a prime interest on excellent information systems. The  ÒAIMS teamÓ (Agricultural Information Management Standards)  in FAO is engaged in helping to set standards and methodologies for easier sharing and exchange of Agricultural information"
Capacity Development for Agriculture Data WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/capacity-development-agriculture-data-wg,yes,"Introduction

 

This case statement is an effort to highlight the adequate need for capacity development of research data and open data practitioners in agriculture and related sciences, in particular to the existing RDA working groups related to IGAD. It shall broadly look at the existing gaps that requires urgent attention, so as to provide the right capacity for roles of all the stakeholders within the agriculture and nutrition ecosystem that can support international development goals. It shall present diverse use cases and linkages to different sectors of development, and cites resources for more in-depth examination of capacity development issues. It will aim to provide in-depth strategic actionable insights into capacity and capabilities necessary for managing todayÕs large scale data assets and opportunities for stakeholders to network; set methodologies for curriculum development and new approaches to some of the key techniques and tools for agricultural data management. It will provide practitioners with the necessary capacities to contribute to and utilize the vast open data ecosystem in agriculture and nutrition.

 

1. Rationale

 

The aim of this Working Group (WG) is to develop synergies between existing education and training activities and agricultural science needs by performing a landscape assessment to identify existing gaps and training requirements within the Interest Group on Agricultural Data (IGAD) WGs related. A particular focus will be on sharing knowledge about training initiatives and technologies, reducing digital divides so that researchers and practitioners in developing countries can also benefit. It will also empower the existing collaboration with GODAN and GODAN Action.

 

 

Formed in 2013, since its inception the Interest Group on Agricultural Data (IGAD) has grown in community strength to becoming one of the RDAÕs most prominent Thematic Groups. IGAD is a domain-oriented group working on all issues related to global agriculture data. It represents stakeholders in managing data for agricultural research and innovation, including producing, aggregating and consuming data. Beyond this IGAD promotes good practices in research with regard to data sharing policies, data management plans and data interoperability, and it is a forum for sharing experience and providing visibility to research and work in agricultural data.

 

At the RDA 9 in Barcelona , more than 100 data experts from more than 35 countries came together for the IGAD pre-meeting where the participants were briefed about ongoing activities of IGAD Working Groups (WGs) and conveyed new ideas through the proposals for  future work. At the RDA9 Pre-meeting for IGAD there was strong interest for developing a WG for building synergies in Capacity Development, in the context of research data in agriculture and its potential contribution to the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

 

2. Proposal

 

The  Capacity Development Working Group aims to

 

    Perform a landscape assessment to identify existing gaps and training requirements within the context of IGAD network including GODAN
        Using existing needs assessment survey data from GODAN Action
        Literature review of existing training capacity challenges and opportunities, taking into account language barriers
        Focused around an identified IGAD research data community
    Present a report of the landscape assessment to RDA11 and circulate for expert comment.
    Develop a case study around an identified community to identify good practices for capacity development and advocacy.
    Build synergies with other initiatives, such as GODAN Action,  to  increase the coherence and impact on the delivery of training.

 

The working group aims to identify and mitigate the gaps in capacity development as evidenced by the needs assessment of the different stakeholders in domains under agriculture. The WG also aims to map and enlist the active initiatives, organisations and agencies already involved in capacity development activities  and build synergies between them and then evidence needs of the stakeholders. In view of the above, we will identify possible stakeholders such as the content providers, technology solution providers, user community (practitioners, researchers, policy makers) and resource persons.

 

3. Value proposition

 

There is a recognised need for capacity development in the fields of agricultural data management. A number of different organisations are attempting to address this, however there does not appear to be a coordinated approach across all agricultural domains which can adequately identify training gaps and make recommendations. Language is a further obstacle for identifying and evaluating existing resources. This working group aims to address this gap by acting as a hub for coordinating the development and provision of training to agriculture practitioners, researchers and policy makers.

This WG outputs will be of benefit to a wide range of stakeholders, users and communities in the Agriculture and Nutrition domain.

Key impacts

    Reduce effort and duplication in development of curricula
    Support capacity development for individuals, communities, and initiatives that will benefit from utilising Agricultural data outputs
    Advocate for collaborative efforts agriculture and nutrition open data initiatives through knowledge sharing among capacity development activities
    Advocate programs, good practices, and lessons learned that enable the use of open data. Promote capacity development and diversity of open data users for a more effective accessibility, use, engagement and understand of open data.

 

4. Work plan

 

The deliverables for the Capacity Development WG will be:

 

    Bring multidisciplinary inputs about best practices into the curriculum development process for Agriculture data with the objective to expand the societal impact of open agricultural research.
    To explore ideas for closer collaborations between RDA/IGAD - RDA/Geospatial IG - GODAN Capacity Development - CODATA and synergies to set up joint education and training activities on Open Data in food and agricultural sciences.  We will work with RDA-CODATA Summer Schools, Teaching TDM for Education and skills development initiatives to build synergies. A particular focus will be on sharing knowledge about training programs and platforms for reducing digital divides so that researchers in developing countries can also benefit.

 

The outcomes for the Capacity Development WG will be:

 

    Report on the current landscape assessment.
    From the landscape assessment, identify and report, with interested stakeholders, existing capacity gaps, including language barriers.
    Develop a case study around the identified community to identify good practices for capacity development and advocacy
    Initiate ideas for Joint training programs in Agricultural data (both online and hands- on ) in collaboration with interested organisations for example GODAN as well as other IGs in RDA (Geospatial IG)

 

7. Milestones

 Deliverables and Outcomes

 Engagement

 

IGAD has spearheaded two important capacity development initiatives. These include two introductory online MOOCS course on data management, principally aimed at learners in Latin America, and four Forums on Open Data and Open Science in Agriculture for Africa. The MOOCs courses offer an introduction to themes of data management using examples from the international sphere and with a particular focus on data management research in fisheries and nutrition. As well as teaching how to define data; the course shall look at issues of data storage, sharing and long term preservation, highlighting the different resources available to researchers in data management.  IGAD leads the course in conjunction with the FAO of the United Nations, SpainÕs Polytechnic University of Valencia and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).

 

The goal of the forums is to provide a platform for stakeholders in Africa to share knowledge on institutional and national initiatives aimed at enhancing the visibility, accessibility and usability of agricultural data and science, and the potential contribution to the realization of AfricaÕs sustainable development goals and the SDGs. We aim to reach out to GODAN Capacity Building activities to expand our synergies and work jointly for expanding capacity development in agriculture data globally.

 

Work Plan

A specific and detailed description of how the WG will operate includes:

 

    The final deliverables of the Capacity Development in Agriculture Data WG will consist of:
        A landscape assessment on the current state of play for agricultural research data with emphasis on a selected case study group
        Good practice guidelines for identifying and addressing capacity gaps, derived from the case study (Including guidance on advocacy to support adoption )
        A capacity building resource hosted on the RDA website

 

    Milestones for the WG shall include:

 

    November 2017 - Submission of the WG Case Statement to  RDA
    November 2017 (M1) - Acceptance and endorsement of the WG Case Statement by  RDA?
    March 2018 (M5)  - Identified an Ag data community for the case study and completed and initial landscape assessment to identify the current state of play for the community,
    March 2018 (M5) - Present a draft report on the current state of play for the case study community to IGAD @ RDA11.
    April 2018 (M6) - Circulate report to IGAD community for expert feedback
    April 2019 (M18) - Report of good practices and lessons learned
    April 2019 (M18) - Handover of developed research data capacity development resource to the wider IGAD/RDA community

    A description of how the WG plans to develop consensus, address conflicts, stay on track and within scope, and move forward during operation

The WG will have all the discussions through the IGAD maillists to ensure openness and inclusivity  in the capacity development training activities. This will ensure all viewpoints are discussed in an open and participatory way.

As contributors will be meeting regularly through GoTo Meeting facility and various conferences, they will be in an ideal position to let the wider agricultural community know about the importance and the status of the work done within the WG.

 

Adoption Plan

Work for Agreement among key agriculture capacity building communities (GODAN, IGAD, CODATA etc) by April 2019 to expand synergies in training programs using the guidelines developed as part of the deliverables has been established as an objective of the WG."
Agrisemantics WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/agrisemantics-wg.html,yes,"Agricultural information encompasses diverse types of data , from policy, technical and
scientific textual documents, through visualizations of temporally and spatially explicit
information, to scientific data and models to allow nowcasting and forecasting of agricultural
outcomes. Many, if not all, of these types of data are regularly sought after and used by
experts in agriculture and poverty reduction, in order to understand the current situation in a
given geographical context, identify current and predicted trends, and define actions and
policies to implement. However, much of that information is described and catalogued using
natural language and adhoc
semantics, which limits the potential for unified search across
different information systems, and makes the use and reuse of data for tasks such as impact
assessment, extraction of trends or projections into the future extremely laborious and hardly
replicable.
""Semantic Interoperability is usually defined as the ability of services and systems to
exchange data in a meaningful/useful way.""1 In practice, achieving semantic interoperability
is a hard task, in part because the description of data (their meanings, methodologies of
creation, relations with other data etc.) is difficult to separate from the contexts in which the
data are produced. This problem is evident even when trying to use or compare data sets
about seemingly unambiguous observations, such as the height of a given crop (depending
on how height was measured, at which growth phase, under what cultural conditions, ...).
Another difficulty with achieving semantic interoperability is the lack of the appropriate set of
tools and methodologies that allow people to produce and reuse semanticallyrich
data,
while staying within the paradigm of open, distributed and linked data.
The use and reuse of accurate semantics for the description of data, datasets and services,
and to provide interoperable content (e.g., column headings, and data values) should be
supported as community resources at an infrastructural level. Such an infrastructure should
enable data producers to find, access and reuse the appropriate semantic resources for their
data, and produce new ones when no reusable resource is available. The Agrisemantics
working group aims at being a community hub for the diffusion of knowledge and practices
related to semantic interoperability in agriculture, and to serve a common place where the
future of data interoperability through semantics will be envisaged.
International context & related actions
Many communities and institutions are organizing themselves to develop open data policies,
virtual environment for research and distributed infrastructure to enable them. The diagram
below (JC
Burgelman keynote http://bit.ly/1C03XWf) represents the importance and use of
data in a few broad domain of knowledge.
1 RDA DFT group definition: http://smwrda.
esc.rzg.mpg.de/index.php/Semantic_Interoperability
One can notice that physics and citizen science are mentioned as the branches of science
producing the most and least of data respectively. This is especially understandable in the
European context where CERN alone is regularly producing impressive amount of data, and
where citizen science is still predominantly a niche. One can also notice that agriculture is
not mentioned anywhere in the graphic, leaving one to wonder what the reason for this is.
We believe that there are two causes. On the one hand, the domain is simply behind on this
path, as evidenced by the small number of open data sets in agriculture. On the other hand,
agriculture is a broad domain, and any assessment of agricultural systems cannot do without
knowledge about species and varieties, climate, and cultural and economic issues, to
mention only a few. This latter consideration further emphasizes the importance of data
sharing and semantic interoperability, and pushes us to work on a new version of the
graphics, where agriculture appears as a topic, and as a community able to reuse and
process data produced within different contexts.
There have been several reports established by important agriculture organizations (see
below) about the importance of data in agriculture. A number of projects and initiatives are
currently ongoing that relate to one or more of semantics, agricultural data and
einfrastructure.
Initial participants in the WG are associated to one or more of those listed
below, which ensures that relevant work produced in those projects is reused within the WG
and diffused to the community of peers. Such close ties with relevant ongoing initiatives will
also allow the Working Group to reach a wide audience and so effectively propagate its
results.
eROSA

GODAN Action (20162019)
is a 3,5 year project funded by the Department for International
Development UK, and led by Wageningen UR, The aim of the project is to produce more
evidencebased
decision making, to improve service delivery in agriculture and nutrition,
databased business creation, actor empowerment and increased transparency of decision
making. GODAN Action has identified three focal areas where research and capacity
building investment is urgently required. The area relevant to the WG is interoperability of
agriculture and nutritional open data (including metadata schemes, semantic standards and
classification systems), with the goal to increase use of standards in data management and
information systems, and increase collaboration between agricultural and nutritional open
data standards initiatives.
GACS (Global Agricultural Concept Scheme, 20142016)
was a working group formed by
FAO, CABI and NAL to explore the possibility of a common repository of conceptual and
terminological information related to agriculture. Shaped as a project funded by inkind
contribution, GACS brought together the thesauri of the three organizations AGROVOC
,
CAB Thesaurus , and NAL Thesaurus , respectively and produced a ÒcoreÓ of about 15,000
multilingual concepts shared by the three thesauri. The first result of the GACS working
group was presented in May 2016, and after a phase of community feedback, the workplan
of GACS is currently being updated.
AgroPortal ( http://agroportal.lirmm.fr/ ) is an interinstitutional,
LIRMMsupported
initiative, a
web ontology portal which features ontology hosting, search, versioning, visualization,
comment, recommendation, enables semantic annotation, as well as storing and exploiting
ontology alignments. It reuses the technology developed by the National Center for
Biomedical Ontology within the BioPortal project. AgroPortal gives access to a set of
semantic assets relevant to agriculture and nutrition. It embodies a distributed approach to
ontology management but central registry and storage, and unified querying functionalities.
As of September 2016, AgroPortal offers 51 ontologies dedicated to agronomy, food, and
plant and the repository is intended to grow in the next months.
agINFRA+ (20172020)
is a ECfunded
project embracing the vision of an open and
participatory dataintensive
science. agINFRA+ continues the work carried out within the
agINFRA project (20112014)
on the design and implementation of a data infrastructure. It
makes use of core einfrastructures
such as EGI , OpenAIRE , EUDAT and D4Science, in
order to provide a sustainable channel addressing adjacent but not fully connected user
communities around agriculture and food.
AGRIS ( http://agris.fao.org/ ) (International System for Agricultural Science and Technology)
is a global public database providing access to bibliographic information on agricultural
science and technology. The database is maintained by CIARD, and its content is provided
by participating institutions from all around the globe that form the network of AGRIS
centers. One of the main objectives of AGRIS is to improve the access and exchange of
information serving the informationrelated
needs of developed and developing countries on
a partnership basis. At the same time, AGRIS is a collaborative network of more than 150
institutions from 65 countries, maintained by FAO of the UN, promoting free access to
agricultural information and covering the wide range of subjects related to agriculture,
including forestry, animal husbandry, aquatic sciences and fisheries, human nutrition, and
extension.
NOAW (No AgroWaste)
is a H2020 project (20162020)
involving 32 partners from 10
european countries, China and Taiwan. Driven by a Ònear zerowasteÓ
society requirement,
the goal of NoAW project is to generate innovative efficient approaches to convert growing
agricultural waste issues into ecoefficient
biobased
products opportunities with direct
benefits for both environment, economy and EU consumer. INRA will test and extend the
semantic web platform @Web ( http://www6.inra.fr/catiicatatweb
) to annotate a selection of
experimental data produced during the project. Those annotated data will be reused in
specific decision supports systems (DSS) (by example food packaging selection DSS).
Ontologies used to annotate data are automatically replicated on the AgroPortal. NOAW is a
candidate usecase
for Deliverable 2 and could contribute to develop recommendations in
Deliverable 3.
The Integrated Modelling partnership (IM) is a global consortium dedicated to supporting
the production of semantically rich, consistent and interoperable scientific data and models.
IM uses high level domain ontologies, a semantic annotation language (k.IM), and an open
source software stack (k.LAB) to achieve reuse and interoperability of data and model
artifacts in the ecological, social, agricultural and economic domains. Particular emphasis is
put on to the use of open standards and controlled vocabularies maintained by authoritative
bodies, that the k.LAB software links with its formal ontology framework. The flagship project
of the IM partnership is ARIES ( http://aries.integratedmodelling.org) . ARIES is dedicated to
the assessment and valuation of ecosystem services, and used worldwide by policy makers
and scientists for environmental assessment and decision in coupled humannatural
systems.
The Wheat Information System ( www.WheatIS.org) is an international project supported by
the Wheat Initiative, a G20 initiative. It promotes and improves standards for data sharing in
a common web portal, backed by a distributed search engine, therefore supporting the
wheat research community. The IGAD Wheat Data Interest Group has built for the WheatIS
a cookbook to disseminate good practices for semantically rich data sharing in the WheatIS
community, including key research institute like INRA, BBSRC, CSIRO, TGAC, EMBLEBI,
Rothamsted and USDA.
The Crop Ontology ( www.cropontology.org) initiated by the Generation Challenge
Programme (GCP, http://www.generationcp.org/ ) provides a framework and a portal for trait
and agronomy controlled vocabularies building and sharing. Those are used in the CGIAR
research centers and their usefulness has been demonstrated in the field for years. The crop
ontology good practices are used in other systems and are disseminated through the
WheatIS cookbook. They are used in key european projects like Elixir or EPPN.
AgGateway ( www.aggateway.org ) is a nonprofit
consortium of over 200 organizations,
primarily in the private sector, dedicated to the implementation of data standards for
interoperability in agriculture. AgGateway has operated for over 10 years in supplychain
processes. For the last 5 it has also been active in field operations, where it has multiple
active projects: SPADE (interoperability in field operations, grain handling and asset
management), PAIL (interoperability in irrigation and observations & measurements), and
ADAPT (implementation of a common object model and format conversion framework). All of
these have strong semantic interoperability components, including the creation of variable
registries, reference data APIs, and leveraging of existing controlled vocabularies..
Charter
The RDA Agrisemantics WG aims at serving as a communitydriven
initiative to advance on
a shared view on the role of semantics for data sharing and interoperability, especially for
data related to agriculture. The Working Group will define a high level view on the use of
semantics assets and on the needed infrastructure to achieve better data sharing and
interoperability in agriculture.
The WG intends to organize its work in phases. First, the group will set a common ground for
the working group and the community (e.g., shared definition of infrastructure, semantic
interoperability, and the general view of an agrisemantics landscape). Then, the group will
proceed and identify a few use cases to facilitate the sharing of ideas communitywide,
and
will then move and collect functional, nonfunctional
and social requirements for the effective
use of semantics to improve data interoperability. The final output of the working group
will be a set of recommendations for designing the future of semantics to enable
interoperability of agricultural data. The document is expect to serve as a roadmap for
future design of semanticallyoriented
software and data infrastructural components.
During its activities, the group will consider the various aspects involved in an infrastructure,
especially software and services for the various stages of a data lifecycle. The data
publication on the Web using linked open data principles will be particularly encouraged.
Moreover, semantic assets (ontologies, thesauri, code lists, ..), data and metadata schemes
for various areas related to agriculture will be considered.
The WG intends to:
1. Liaise with the GODAN Action on a survey the project is going to distribute in late
2016, to gather information on the use of semantic assets to describe datasets. The
WG will build its activities also on the information collected through the survey.
2. Liaise with INRA on the bibliometric study on academic publications that it is going to
carry on to identify key players and most studied semantics related issues, better
qualify which agricultural subdomains already benefit from semantics and which do
not, and to what purposes.
3. Liaise with GODAN Action to provide input to the project deliverable on mapping of
standards, by reporting on the technical solutions and practices adopted by WG
members for editing, mapping, publishing and using semantic assets? and finally
identify possible difficulties faced by the community.
4. Promote the reuse and sharing of semantic assets, following the W3C semantic web
format, to describe agricultural data.
5. Identify a set of Use Cases to represent various domains and situations in which the
correct semantic interpretation of agricultural data is crucial for building systems or
support analysis. Subsequent work on requirements and a roadmap will build on the
Use Cases.
6. Study einfrastructures
involving semantics in other domains (biomedicine,
environment, pharmaceutics, etc.)
7. Liaise with the eROSA
project to select infrastructural component related to the
management, use or reuse of semantic assets for which recommendations should be
developed.
8. Liaise with the GACS Working Group as a key stakeholder in the area of
maintenance and use of semantic assets.
9. Liaise with other RDA groups (see next section for details) to reuse their outputs and
coordinate efforts and vision.
10. Liaise with private sector initiatives such as those of AgGateway, to identify common
semantic interoperability problems and work toward common solutions.
Value proposition
Individuals, communities and initiatives that will benefit from the WG
recommendations.
The WG recommendations will be a major contribution to the eROSA
roadmap. Specifically,
the WG Recommendations will contribute to the part of the roadmap that concerns
infrastructure to support editing, access, publication and use of semantic assets.
As a consequence, the WG recommendations are expected to benefit the private sector by
highlighting services and requirements to be taken into considerations when developing new
products.
The recommendations developed by the WG are intended to benefit data and information
managers dealing with semantic assets, by pointing at future directions in the field.
Key impacts of WG recommendations
The tangible impacts expected from the WG output:
1. Spread knowledge within (and outside) RDA on the role of semantics for addressing
interoperability issues.
2. Guide agricultural stakeholders into the development of semantic solutions and
products using standards and shared tools, services and practices for data
maintenance, publication and use.
3. Produce a communitybuilt
proposal for the role and requirements for the
development of an infrastructure that supports semantics for data interoperability in
agriculture.
4. Move semantics into the agenda of EC funding frameworks.
5. Present to funding bodies the ÒwhyÓ and ÒwhatÓ should be promoted for the advances
of knowledge and policymaking
in agriculture.
Engagement with existing work in the area
The Agrisemantics WG is a working group within the RDA Interest Group on Agricultural
Data (IGAD). The working group will closely liaise with the other working group within IGAD,
primarily the now concluded Wheat Data Interoperability to reuse the part of their output on
vocabularies, and the soon to be formed group on Rice Data Interoperability.
Other Working and Interest groups in RDA are also relevant to the Agrisemantics WG. In
particular, we have identified the following groups for participation and exchange of
information and feedback:
Vocabulary
Services Interest Group
BoF
on Domain Vocabulary Development, Standardization, Registration,
Harmonization and Support
Repository
Core Description WG
Metadata
IG
New relevant development within RDA will be closely monitored, to ensure that no effort is
duplicated and that the impact of RDA outputs is maximized.
Moreover, the group will leverage the active involvement of its members in many related and
complementary projects already in place (see Section ÒInternational contextÓ in this
document) to better achieve its goals. The WG will also organise and encourage the
community to participate in education and dissemination events such as workshops,
datathons or hackathons (e.g., AgroHackathon Meetup Series ).
During the course of its activities, the WG will also actively promote its activities so as to
involve more experts in the group, to enhance the possibilities of dialogue in the community.
Work Plan
Form and description of final deliverables
1. A report on ÒSemantics Landscape for Agricultural DataÓ, presenting the current
situation on semantics for data interoperability in agriculture. This document will
serve as a basis for discussion among practitioners and data producers dealing with
different types of agricultural data.
2. A report consisting of a set of use cases and requirements drawn from the
discussions engaged within the Agrisemantics community.
3. A document on ÒRecommendationsÓ for the future of semantics for agricultural data
and supporting infrastructure. The document will touch upon software, functionalities,
and semantic assets to enhance data interoperability in agriculture. This document
will build upon the knowledge and experience gained during the first phase of the
WG activities, and the results presented in the abovementioned reports. The
recommendations will provide a roadmap for future work on infrastructures to support
semantic assets.

WGÕs mode and frequency of operation
Participation in the WG is voluntary and not every WG member will be able to contribute
equally. Therefore, we aim to maximise membersÕ contributions by focussing on membersÕ
specific interests, and also ensure that all members can contribute to internal reviews.
Communication will be based on regular online meetings and group writing on shared
documents. Extra meetings and events will be organized to carry out specific activities. A
few facetoface
meetings and workshops will also be organized, as much as possible
colocated
with other events so as to maximise participation and feedback. The events
currently foreseen are the following:
1) Panel session at MTSR, Nov 2016
2) Kick off meeting of eRosa
and agINFRA+ projects (colocated),
January, 2016 in

Achieving consensus, addressing conflicts, and staying on task and within scope
? Consensus will be reached via open discussion, voting, and majority considerations
informed by evidence where possible.
? Conflict will first be addressed by WG leaders. An escalation procedure will be
drafted, for example the RDA Council will be consulted, and an independent person
not in the WG will be brought in to mediate the conflict.
? Staying on task and within scope: the WG leaders have good experience in projects
management and standards development. The key mechanism for reaching
consensus will be through examining evidence and identifying limitations of
applicability of competing ideas. In addition, of course, we will agree on a detailed
schedule and track action items.
Planned approach to broader community engagement and participation
The WG creation will be announced widely using RDA communication means, including
participation to P8 IGAD meetings, mailing lists, social networks. The WG launch is planned
to take place (or at least announced) at the MTSR conference (2225
November 2016, in
Gšttingen, Germany). The participation of WG members in the AgroSEM special track on
Metadata and Semantics for Agriculture, Food & Environment should attract additional
domain experts and allow the identification of new use cases.
The activities of the WG will be regularly presented by its members in events (conferences,
project meetings, etc) in particular those organized by the agriculture and nutrition
communities, in order to get more people involved and have some feedback on ongoing
activities. Social networks and RDA communication facilities will be used to inform on the
WG activities and outputs.
Adoption Plan
eROSA
The H2020 Coordination and support action eROSA
will take into account the ÒState of the
ArtÓ WG output in its planned activity of landscaping the digital agriculture science
community and practices (WP1). Our results may enrich the agINFRA portal. The strengths,
weaknesses, requirements and gaps in the specific field of semantics that will have been
identified by the WG will help eROSA
describing what is available in terms of data and
technical solutions to address grand challenges (WP2). We aim at the recommendations
delivered by the WG to be included in the Foresight Roadmap Paper that will be the final
output of the H2020 Coordination and support action eROSA
(WP3).
AgroPortal
Within the WG span, we plan to submit a H2020 einfra
project mainly dedicated to the use
of ontologies and the development of AgroPortal. We have already designed and
implemented an advanced prototype. With the Agrisemantics partners, we plan to turn that
prototype into a real service to the community. We think that this platform can offer a robust
and stable reference repository that will become highly valuable for the agronomic domain.
NOAW
INRA will inspire from the recommendations and other outputs of the WG to design and
implement the H2020 NOAW project Data Management plan of which INRA is in charge.
INRA will also communicate WG recommendations to partners of the project.
GACS
The Global Agricultural Concept Scheme (GACS) Working Group concluded its first phase of
activities in May 2016. The product of that first phase was a set of some 15,000 concepts in
up to 25 languages, originated from three major thesauri in the area of agriculture, namely
AGROVOC, CAB Thesaurus and NALT. Work is planned to continue from late 2016 through
2017, placing a stronger emphasis on topicdriven
sets of concepts, to be used as reference
identities for the expression of the semantics of data. The future work of GACS is expected
to be an important source of requirements and firsthand
experience in the use of semantic
assets in the context of textual documents as well as numeric data.
FAO
As an active member of the GACS working group, FAO is going to actively participate also in
the RDA Agrisemantics WG, to contribute to the communitywide
discussion promoted by
RDA with its experience in terms of requirements and recommendations. After validation by
the community, FAO will promote internally to the organization the adoption of the WG
recommendations for what concerns the lifecycle of metadata production.
k.LAB
As k.LAB uses formal semantics to provide access to distributed datasets and allow their
use in dataflows, recommendations and vocabularies endorsed by the WG will be adopted
as authoritative in all semantic annotations related to the themes of interest of the WG. This
will affect all users and developers of projects for which k.LAB provides the enabling
infrastructure, such as ARIES.
Use Cases
The providers of the collected use cases are expected adopters of the WG
recommendations as they will be developed partially upon the requirements formulated from
the use cases.
INRA
Recommendations and other outputs of the WG will be adopted by the Department of
Scientific and Technical Information to improve the services and tools offered to INRA
agents who actually or want to maintain, publish, and use vocabularies and semantized
data."
"Earth, Space, and Environmental Science Complex Citations Working Group",https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/earth-space-and-environmental-science-complex-citations-working-group,no,"The ESIP/RDA Earth, Space, and Environmental Sciences Interest Group is forming a working group to examine and make recommendations around complex citations that continue to be challanging.

International Materials Resource Registries WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/working-group-international-materials-resource-registries.html,yes,"1.1 Mission
As a domain, Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) is exceptionally broad
and interdisciplinary with its origins most directly from metallurgy, ceramics and
polymer science, but also with important ties to other disciplines such as physics,
chemistry, chemical engineering, geology, electronics, optics, and biology. As a
global community, MSE is expanding rapidly worldwide through the
establishment of large, multi-institutional academic research centers, government
labs, industrial consortia, and computing facilities. MSE researchers often need
to answer complex questions such as ÒWhat structural properties and processing
methods are required to develop new lightweight materials that significantly
improve fuel efficiency yet meet safety standards satisfied by traditional materials
in use today?Ó To this end we have seen the creation of programs such as the
Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) in the US that aim to decrease the cost and
time to develop new materials by a factor of two through more effective
discovery, access, and interoperability of experimental and simulation data.
However, finding the latest materials data and resources to answer such
questions amidst this rich diversity and accelerated growth is an increasingly
difficult and time-consuming endeavor.
In response, the RDA/CODATA Materials Data, Infrastructure, and
Interoperability Interest Group (MDII IG; co-chairs James Warren, NIST, and
Laura Bartolo, Northwestern University) in collaboration with materials science
professional societies, proposes to create its first Working Group focused on
developing the metadata standards required to establish a network of
International Materials Resource Registries (IMRR) in key sub-domains and
regions.
Developing a successful international materials science resource registry
requires a combination of technical and political process. As an outgrowth to
discussions held in MDII IG working sessions and based on knowledge of the
materials community, MDII IG proposes core members for its Working Group.
The core members would be comprised of ÒdoersÓ in the materials and cognate
communities to identify those in their organizations who need to be involved.
CVs have been collected and are included in this proposal to demonstrate MDII
IGÕs beliefs that leadership f is required rom a diverse set of organizations and
that these people hold positions to ensure action will follow.
As an Interest Group, MDII brings forward its Working Group proposal to
TAB because RDA, by its nature, provides a platform for building international
consensus. MDII IG believes that RDA offers the leverage and vehicle needed to
embrace communities who want to build data discovery, access, and
interoperability capabilities under its aegis.
A resource registry is a system that harvests and makes searchable highlevel
metadata descriptions of resources held by data repositories, archives,
organizations, websites, and services to aid scientists in industry, universities,
and government labs in the discovery of data relevant to their research and work
interests. The IMRR WG will be comprised of an international committee
representing different regions and sectors, including Asia, Europe, and North
America with MDII IG Co-Chairs as ex-officio members. A Convener will be
responsible for coordinating the activities of the Working Group and will facilitate
interactions with other closely-related Interest and Working groups.
Invited core members include:
Convenor: Chandler Becker ODI, MML, NIST US
Core Members: Scott Henry ASM IntÕl * US
Brian Matthews STFC UK

The proposed materials resource registry would develop a common?
framework for high level description of materials resources, including data,
simulations, software, and instrumentation with respect to open standards to
support materials data sharing as well as collaborative efforts. The materials
resource registry work would determine minimal metadata for materials
resources listed in the registries such as data collections, services, and tools.
The registry work would facilitate access, discovery, use, and re-use through
technical and social infrastructure development with the community: metadata,
vocabularies, formats, and best practices. Working in close collaboration with
complementary RDA Working Groups and Interest Groups (e.g., Domain
Repositories IG, Metadata IG and WG, Photon Neutron Science IG, and
Metadata Standards Catalog WG), the IMRR would serve as a potential test bed
for integration of emerging RDA products that meet the needs and interests of
the materials science community.
Given the broad reach, the multiple sub-domains and international efforts
of MSE, and the substantial global materials data initiatives, the timing is
?

opportune for the materials science professional societies to collaborate with the
RDA on an international materials resource registry project. The US National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a leadership role in MGI and
the international MSE community and is willing to provide technical support for
this initiative with RDA, international materials research organizations, and
professional societies.
1.2 Stakeholders
The proposed establishment of a network of materials resource registries would
connect with key stakeholders across the international materials communities:
¥ Individual Level: scientists in industry, universities, and government labs
¥ National Level: centers and consortia in industry and universities,
professional societies in materials science and engineering
¥ International Level: CODATA, other joint international initiatives
¥ Cognate Areas: Interdisciplinary ties across STEM, such as with the
Photon/Neutron IG
1.3 Goals (See section 4, Work Plan and Operation for more detail)
1.3.1 Short term (12 to 18 Months)
¥ Define and build consensus around minimum required metadata for
materials science data discovery
¥ Deploy metadata schema using pilot registry infrastructure developed
by NIST
¥ Validate with materials science data collections at organizations
participating in the Working Group
1.3.2 Long term (Post 18 Months)
¥ Build, Grow, and Maintain a Social/Technical Global Network of IMRRs
2. Value Proposition, Beneficiaries, and Key Impacts:
2.1 Value Proposition
The IMRR would consist of high-level resource descriptions that would be
harvested into a federated registry using the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for
Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). Its establishment would promote:
¥ Discovery and sharing of materials resources
o Organizations (University, Research Group, Government)
o Data Collections (Repository, Project Archive, Database)
o Datasets
o Services
o Informational Sites
o Software
¥ Bridging the gap between distributed resources and users
¥ Support for collaboration and reuse of data and resources
¥ Access to complex, heterogeneous, distributed data for many users
2.2 Beneficiaries
The IMRR would benefit its stakeholders (1.2) as well as the international STEM
communities. The process for building out sufficient, but not excessive, metadata
to serve data discovery needs in materials science will be documented and can
serve as both a social and technical model for initiatives in other disciplines.
2.3 Key Impacts
¥ Establish a common, framework for high level description of materials
resources.
¥ Facilitate access, discovery, use, and re-use of a wide range of distributed
materials resources.
¥ Encourage materials data sharing as well as support collaborative efforts.
¥ Improve the return on investment in materials science data.
3. Engagement with existing work in the area:
The IMRR would build upon and continue engagement with:
Research Data Alliance (RDA)
¥ Its social and technical bridges to enable open sharing of data.
¥ Its vision of researchers and innovators openly sharing data across
technologies, disciplines, and countries to address the grand
challenges of society.
OpenAIRE (Europe)
¥ Discovery of publications, projects, data, people, organizations, and
data sources.
¥ Open access to publications and datasets
Virtual Observatory (VO)
¥ Discovery of datasets from thousands of astronomical collections
known to the VO over wide areas of the sky.
The VO and its governing body, the International Virtual Observatory Alliance,
would serve as an important model of a federated data environment for
conducting research on the network:
¥ Federates thousands of archives, databases, and services around the world
¥ Open interoperability standards integrate community web tools, web services,
desktop apps, and software libraries
¥ Discovery Framework (part of VO Ð set of standards)
¥ General data model and standards that supports discovery of a broad
variety of resources
¥ Datasets, records in databases, services, useful websites
¥ Extensible metadata model that can be customized for different types of
resources
¥ Allows data providers to expose collection-specific (non-standard)
metadata into discovery process
¥ Allows data providers to support standards incrementally
¥ Simple registration to inform world that the website exists
¥ Can add further support for standards as able to increase visibility within
federation
4. Work Plan and Operation
The scope of this activity would fit well into an 18-month timeline. Schedule
milestones are as follows:
4.1 Recruit Domain Experts, Survey Landscape and Begin Discussions (M 1-3)
Month 1 (JanÕ16): recruit domain specialists to participate in the WG
Month 2 (late Feb/early MarÕ16): initiate discussions about conducting a survey
of existing materials science data providers in order to build on existing
experience and expertise; develop 20 typical data discovery queries to inform
metadata discussions
Month 3 (March Ð April Õ16): hold meeting to draft first version of metadata
extensions to Dublin Core
4.2 Disseminate Preliminary Findings, Solicit Feedback and Convene 2nd Meeting
(M 4-8)
Months 4-8 (Apr Ð Aug Õ16): disseminate draft to the materials science
community, both within and external to RDA, and solicit feedback
Month 8 (AugÕ16): hold second two-day meeting to refine metadata extensions
and establish implementation pilot program (e.g., NIST Materials Repository,
NDS Materials Data Facility, and others to be determined within the WG)
4.3 Implement and Test Pilot MSE RR, Prepare initial Documentation and Revise
(M 8-16)
Months 9-12 (Sept Ð Dec Õ16): implement pilot federated registry and recruit
testers/evaluators; evaluate granularity issues (at what level does one aggregate
service descriptions?) and write best-practices guideline document
Months 13-15 (Jan Ð Mar 17): fine tune metadata definitions and document
metadata development process: what worked well, what did not; expand the
content of the pilot registry
4. 4 Prepare Final Report (M 16-18)
Months 16-18 (Apr -- JunÕ17): prepare final document for delivery to RDA at P10
5) Adoption Plan:
The deliverable for this Working Group would be a document defining a minimum
level of metadata needed to facilitate discovery in the materials sciences. At the
core of the metadata definition would be the Dublin Core metadata, long
established as useful for key provenance information. But similar to the Virtual
Observatory Resource Metadata (http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/RM.html),
the IMRR metadata would include domain-specific extensions to help identify key
types of materials data (polymers, ceramics, semi-conductors, nanomaterials,
etc.). These metadata extensions would be developed through the coordinated
work of domain experts spanning the primary materials science sub-disciplines
working together with metadata design experts. The IMRR would also be
foundational work for the eventual deployment of more detailed data discovery
and utilization services, e.g., using RDF and Linked Data. NIST, for example,
through the Materials Genome Initiative and the Office of Data and Informatics,
Material Measurement Laboratory, would be interested in supporting such a pilot."
FAIR Data Maturity Model WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-data-maturity-model-wg,yes,"Technological advancements have made science more data intensive and interconnected, with researchers producing and sharing increasing volumes of research data. To maximise the value of science, research data (sets) should have four foundational characteristics; they should be:

    'Findable', i.e. discoverable with machine readable metadata, identifiable and locatable by means of a standard identification mechanism;
    'Accessible', i.e. available and obtainable;
    'Interoperable', i.e. both syntactically parseable and semantically understandable, allowing data exchange and reuse among scientific disciplines, researchers, institutions, organisations and countries; and
    'Reusable', i.e. sufficiently described and shared with the least restrictive licences, allowing the widest reuse possible across scientific disciplines and borders, and the least cumbersome integration with other data sources.

Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability Ð the FAIR principles Ð were first introduced in 2014 and intend to define a minimal set of community-agreed guiding principles and practices that allow both machines and humans to find, access, interoperate and re-use research data. The FAIR principles define characteristics that contemporary research data resources, vocabularies and infrastructures should exhibit to assist discovery and reuse by third-parties and they can be further refined into a range of facets that have the potential to: a) improve scientific research, b) contribute to growth and accelerate innovation in a global digital economy, c) increase the reproducibility of research and d) better inform citizens and society about the results and value of research (through thorough and comprehensible description of the data sets).

        problem

The aspirational nature of the FAIR data principles and their rapid adoption at international level has led to an ambiguity and a wide range of interpretations of FAIRness since the principles do not strictly define how to achieve a state of FAIRness but rather they describe a continuum of features, attributes and behaviours that move a digital object closer to that goal. As a result, a number of incompatible methodologies to assess FAIRness have been developed already and relevant work is in under way by various groups.

 

Due to the lack of a common set of core assessment criteria for FAIRness, researchers and organisations cannot evaluate the readiness and implementation level of their datasets vis-ˆ-vis the FAIR data principles in a coherent way. The majority of the available FAIR assessment frameworks: i) produce results which cannot be combined or compared and ii) do not allow a benchmark based on the comparison amongst peers. In addition, research performing organisations and data infrastructures cannot develop or follow a minimum set of shared guidelines to climb up the ladder of FAIR because of the increased heterogeneity of the offered FAIR metrics tools.

        Outcomes

The Working Group ""FAIR data maturity model: core criteria to assess the implementation level of the FAIR data principles"" will bring together stakeholders from different scientific and research disciplines, the industry and public sector, who are active and/or interested in the FAIR data principles and in particular in assessment criteria and methodologies for evaluating their real-life uptake and implementation level. The Working Group will develop as an RDA Recommendation a common set of core assessment criteria for FAIRness and a generic and expandable self-assessment model for measuring the maturity level of a dataset from the following perspectives:

    Data findability, i.e. how well it describes the data it produces or manages with rich metadata, assigns to data/metadata a globally unique persistent identifier and registers or indexes them in a searchable resource;
    Data accessibility, i.e. how well it allows the retrieval of its data/metadata by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol that is open, free and universally implementable;
    Data interoperability, i.e. how well it ensures that the precise format and meaning of exchanged and shared data/metadata is preserved and understood;
    Data reusability, i.e. how well it releases data/metadata with a clear and accessible data usage license, associated with detailed provenance and follows practices that promote the reuse and share of data, unless certain privacy or confidentiality restrictions apply.

In addition, the Working Group will design:

    A self-assessment toolset that enables researchers and organisations to evaluate and improve the readiness and implementation level of their datasets vis-ˆ-vis the FAIR data principles.
    A lightweight version of the FAIR Data Maturity Model (aka FAIR data checklist), aiming to raise awareness on the main aspects related with the FAIR principles.

The outcomes of the Working Group will be possible to be applied not only to data in the conventional sense but also to data-related algorithms, tools, workflows, protocols and other data-related services produced or managed by the assessed entity.

    Value proposition

Given that the outcomes of the Working Group will be in the form of generic and reusable building blocks, researchers and organisations will be in a position to easily apply and extend them in order to address FAIR-related assessment needs specific to their own thematic disciplines and/or countries. That will increase the coherence and interoperability of existing or emerging FAIR assessment frameworks and it will ensure the combination and compatibility of their results in a meaningful way.

 

The outcomes of the Working Group ""FAIR data maturity model: core criteria to assess the implementation level of the FAIR data principles"" will benefit:

    Researchers, data stewards and other data professionals who are involved in the production and management of research data and have to follow good data management and data stewardship practises (which include the notions of data collection, annotation, archival and long-term care, either alone or in combination with newly generated data).
    Data services owners (data infrastructures, data repositories, owners of commercial and open-source tools), who are responsible for setting up and maintaining a data-related services and tools.
    Organisations that capture, generate, manage, share, protect and preserve research data.
    Policymakers who are responsible for defining data policies at international, European and national level.

The Working Group will provide to the aforementioned user categories an instrument with a three-fold nature:

    It will be descriptive, i.e. it will describe the as-is FAIR-related maturity level of a dataset,
    It will be prescriptive, i.e. it will provide guidance to researchers and organisations to improve the implementation of the FAIR data principles (aka 'FAIRness') through recommendations, and
    It will be comparative, i.e. it will allow a benchmark based comparison amongst peers.

In addition, the outcomes of the Working Group are expected to:

    Contribute to growth and accelerate innovation in a global digital economy: since data is becoming increasingly important for all aspects of the international economy, a common set of core assessment criteria and the FAIR Data Maturity Model will improve the readiness and capability of organisations to open up their data in a way that creates potential benefits for their investment plans (a specific example in Europe of the economic impact of opening up data is the Copernicus earth observation system).
    Provide savings in money: the outcomes of the Working Group will ensure money savings to researchers and organisations as it will deliver a reusable solution for measuring the FAIRness of their data. Also, it will contribute to the improvement of their readiness and implementation level of the FAIR principles, which will lead to money savings from the reuse of high-quality data, the combination of data sets across borders or disciplines and the avoidance of duplication.
    Provide savings in time for researchers and organisations aiming to implement the FAIR principles.
    Increase transparency: better and faster implementation of the FAIR data principles will help to increase the reproducibility of research, which currently can be as low as 10-30% in key areas, such as cancer research. This can have a positive impact for the scientific principle of credibility, replication and further research given that the scientific community has repeatedly experienced instances of misconduct and erroneous analyses, which may endanger whole scientific fields

    Engagement with existing work in the area

The Working Group ""FAIR data maturity model: core criteria to assess the implementation level of the FAIR data principles"" must build upon existing relevant efforts at international, European and sectorial level and will complement emerging activities (e.g. funded by the H2020 Work Programme 2018-20) that support the FAIR data uptake and compliance across borders/disciplines.

 

Research Data Alliance offers an ideal environment for an engagement of this kind because RDA can bring deep knowledge from the promotion of research data interoperability at disciplinary levels together with hands-on experience in leveraging such knowledge in order to improve interoperability amongst scientific disciplines too.

 

Two of RDA groups having this twofold nature are the Disciplinary Collaboration Framework Interest Group and the Domain Repositories Interest Group, which both enhance communication with other RDA IGs and WGs and represent the interests of specific disciplines in those groups. The Working Group ""FAIR data maturity model: core criteria to assess the implementation level of the FAIR data principles"" will work closely with the aforementioned Interest Groups aiming to: a) capture interoperability needs between disciplines and in view of specific scientific challenges, b) gather relevant input from different disciplines and c) develop and apply a structured methodology for prioritising, harmonising and efficiently articulating inter-disciplinary needs.

 

In parallel, the Working Group will investigate opportunities for collaboration with existing or emerging RDA groups that address any aspect that is relevant with the implementation of the FAIR data principles, such as the:

    Data Description Registry Interoperability (DDRI) WG
    DMP Common Standards WG
    Exposing Data Management Plans WG
    RDA/FORCE11 FAIR Sharing Working Group
    Metadata Standards Catalog WG
    WDS/RDA Assessment of Data Fitness for Use WG
    Research Data Repository Interoperability WG
    RDA/CODATA Legal Interoperability IG
    Data policy standardisation and implementation IG
    Education and Training on handling of research data IG
    Metadata IG
    PID IG

In addition, the Working Group will engage with pertinent international and European actors and activities such as:

    FAIRmetrics.org: a group collaborating with a broad set of stakeholders to design a framework for evaluating ""FAIRness"" that enables both qualitative and quantitative assessment of the degree to which online resources comply with the FAIR Data principles.
    Horizontal or discipline-specific initiatives to measure the implementation of the FAIR data principles such as:
        DANS FAIR data assessment tool: an online tool prototype which guides the user through a set of questions to assess a specific dataset.
        ARDC FAIR Data self-assessment: a self-assessment tool designed predominantly for data librarians and IT staff to assess the 'FAIRness' of a dataset and determine how to enhance its FAIRness (where applicable).
        CSIRO 5-star data rating tool: a tool that allows users to carry out a self-assessment based on 5 qualities of data Ð Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable and Trusted. For each quality, a number of specific questions have been curated to allow users to rate their data according to its current state.
    GO FAIR: a community-led initiative to contribute to and coordinate the coherent development of the Internet of FAIR Data & Services. GO FAIR is analysing the possibility to organise a FAIR certification mechanism of services, tools, organisations, and people (including data stewards) aiming to help research funders and other stakeholders to promote open science, for instance by enabling researchers to incorporate a certified service in their data stewardship plans.
    FORCE11 FAIR Data Management Plans Working Group: FORCE11, the international community/platform that hosted the open consultation for the definition of the 15 FAIR guiding principles in 2016, has established the ""FAIR DMPs"" Working Group aiming to provide a simple set of principles, along with examples of domain-specific implementations and recommendations for best practices, that emphasizes good data management, stewardship and machine-readablity for making data FAIR.
    RDA/FORCE11 FAIR Sharing Working Group: connecting data policies, standards & databases "" Working Group (former FAIR Sharing WG): a use cases-driven joint effort between RDA and Force11 to develop: a) a set of recommendations to guide users and producers of databases and content standards to select and describe them, or recommend them in data policies, and b) a curated registry, which enacts the recommendations and assists a variety of end users, providing well described, interlinked, and cross-searchable records on content standards, databases and data policies.
    CODATA: the Committee on Data of the International Council for Science (ICSU) that promotes global collaboration to improve the availability and usability of data for all areas of research.
    Science Europe: an association of European Research Funding Organisations (RFO) and Research Performing Organisations (RPO), active in the field of alignment of the research data management policies and templates.
    European Commission Expert Group on ""Turning FAIR data into reality"": established by the Commission, this expert group is working together with European and global initiatives towards a proposal for a FAIR Data Action Plan for consideration by the Commission, Member States and stakeholders in the research and data communities. The draft proposal presented by the Expert Group at the 2nd EOSC Summit on 11 June 2018, suggests the design of an agreed set of basic core FAIR metrics, which will be ""standardised"" and extendible in order to cover the needs and practises of different communities.
    EU-funded projects (e.g. EOSC pilot, EOSC hub, FREYA, Open AIRE Advanced etc.) supporting the first phase in the development of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC):
    European Commission: DG RTD, DG CNECT, DG DIGIT and the Publications Office.

    Work Plan

The Working Group ""FAIR data maturity model: core criteria to assess the implementation level of the FAIR data principles"" will build on top and combine the most salient characteristics of existing efforts for measuring the readiness and implementation level of a dataset vis-ˆ-vis the FAIR data principles.

 

The outcomes of the Working Group (a common set of core assessment criteria for FAIRness in the form of a Recommendation and a generic and expandable self-assessment model for measuring the maturity level of a dataset FAIR) will be generic - and not specific to a certain discipline or country Ð and apply to any type of data in the conventional sense as well as to data-related algorithms, tools, workflows, protocols and other data-related services. They will be based on a core set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive assessment criteria and be populated in a way that allows their extension in order to meet specific FAIR-related assessment needs, at national and/or discipline level (for example, for providing additional layers of detail for a number of discreet areas). Furthermore, design method will allow in the future the provision of estimations about the costs and benefits for organisations, both in economic and non-economic terms, for moving their datasets to a higher FAIR maturity level.

 

The outcomes will be developed following a progressive approach via a number of iterations. In each iteration, the current structure of the FAIR assessment criteria and the maturity model will be examined and validated in order to evolve to a revised version. The development process will be open, ensuring an active and continuous engagement of user communities and stakeholders in all development phases (including scoping, construction and testing). For that purpose, well-defined working and decision-making mechanisms will be defined and agreed from the beginning in order to facilitate the operation of the Working Group.

 

The main phases and deliverables will be the following:

    A: Initiation: during the first phase, the exact scope of the work will be defined including the objectives, the usage and the purpose of the assessment criteria and the model. Similar assessment criteria and models will be systematically analysed in order to identify components that could be reused either as they are or after applying some improvements, aiming to avoid the duplication of efforts.

Main outputs:

    Scope definition
    Literature review: an overview of existing approaches (generic or specific-purpose)

Timeline: M1 Ð M2

    B: Stakeholder identification: the initiation phase will be followed by the identification of the main actors who will be related with the outcomes of the Working Group from three perspectives: development process, execution and interest in the results.

Main outputs:

    Stakeholder matrix

Timeline: M3

    C: Design methodology: the Working Group will define and agree on a systematic, effective and efficient design methodology that will lead to results that are rigorous and both theoretically founded and empirically validated. The design methodology will follow an iterative approach, leveraging the most appropriate techniques for the population of the expected results. A special role should be foreseen for RDA Working Groups and Interest Group with pertinent objectives.

Main outputs:

    Design methodology

Timeline: M4 Ð M6

    D: Design: this phase will define all aspects with regard to the structure and the body of the FAIR assessment criteria and the model. The design phase will answer questions such as:

    How many different maturity stages will be foreseen?
    How many dimensions or layers will the model assess?
    Will be any documented maturation paths?
    How many questions will be included in the model?
    What will be the type of dependencies in the implementation of the foreseen modelÕs capabilities or attributes (implicit / explicit)?
    Which techniques will be used for the population of the model (e.g. literature review, case study interviews, focus groups etc.)?
    Will be the measurement of the maturity quantitative and/or qualitative?

Main outputs:

    Core assessment criteria for FAIR
    FAIR data maturity model
    FAIR data checklist

Timeline: M7 Ð M16

    E: Testing: the assessment criteria and the model will be verified and validated following a well-defined evaluation methodology.

Main outputs:

    Testing results

Timeline: M13 Ð M16

    Delivery: when the main building blocks of the outcomes will be constructed, various characteristics regarding their distribution will be decided such as: what kinds of materials will be publicly available, in what format etc. The exact set of the outputs of this phase will be progressively decided by the members of the Working Group.

Timeline: M17 Ð M18

    Adoption Plan

The members of the Working Group will incorporate the outcomes of their work in their policies and practices that promote the implementation of the FAIR data principles at national, discipline and international level. The set of core assessment criteria for FAIRness will be used as the basis to examine the compatibility and alignment of their instruments (such as recommendations, frameworks, templates, toolsets etc.) and any corrective activities will be planned and implemented in a coherent way. In addition, all members will systematically promote the outcomes to their specific communities, aiming to raise awareness and support their real-life adoption.

 

Furthermore, the Working Group will create and publish a number of guidelines for the extension of the core assessment criteria and the FAIR maturity model by user communities and organisations with specific needs in the evaluation of the implementation of the FAIR data principles. That will allow and facilitate a wider adoption of the outcomes of the Working Group by existing and emerging initiatives."
CURE-FAIR WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/cure-fair-wg,yes,"The goal of the working group is to establish standards-based guidelines for curating for reproducible and FAIR data and code (Wilkinson et al., 2016). Informed by an examination of current curation practices and their alignment with FAIR principles, these guidelines will offer a framework for implementing effective curation workflows for publishing FAIR data and code that support scientific reproducibility. The ultimate objective is to improve FAIR-ness and long-term usability of Òreproducible file bundlesÓ across domains.
When we think of specific research outputs, we might think of data, software, codebooks, etc. These individual outputs may have inherent value. For example, a set of observations that is very costly to produce, or that cannot be repeated, or a script that can be used by others for computation. Traditional curation has considered these outputs as its core objects. But in the context of empirical research, these outputs interact with each other, often to produce specific findings or results. Nowadays, the process by which results are generated is captured in computation. Our approach to curation takes into account this process and focuses on computational reproducibility.
Computational reproducibility is the ability to repeat the analysis and arrive at the same results (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2019; Stodden, 2015). It requires using the data and code used in the original analysis, and additional information about study methods and computational environment. The reason to pursue computational reproducibility is to preserve a complete scientific record, to verify scientific claims, to do science and build upon the findings, and to teach (Elman, Kapieszewski, & Lupia, 2018; Resnik & Shamoo, 2017; Stodden, Bailey, & Borwein, 2013).
In this framework, the object of the curation is a Òreproducible file bundleÓ and its component parts, including the files and their elements (e.g., variables), with the goal of enabling continued access and independent reuse of the bundle for the long term.
The CURE-FAIR WG is focused on the curation practices that support computational reproducibility and FAIR principles.
By curation we refer to the activities designed for Òmaintaining, preserving and adding value to digital research data throughout its lifecycleÓ (Digital Curation Center, n.d.).
The WG will deliver,
1) A snapshot of the current state of CURE-FAIR practices drawing upon community surveys and reviews of practice.
2) A synthesis of practices relating to curating for computational reproducibility and FAIR principles.
3) A final document outlining standards-based guidelines for CURE-FAIR best practices in publishing and archiving computationally reproducible studies, including the associated computational methods and materials.
2. Value Proposition
The main outcome of this WG is a final document outlining standards-based guidelines for CURE-FAIR best practices in publishing and archiving computationally reproducible studies, including the associated computational methods and materials. Bringing together a community of data curators, archivists, repository managers, researchers, scientific publishers, repository software developers, and others can help create consensus around CURE-FAIR guidelines and prevent fragmentation and development of siloed solutions and practices. Data archives, institutional repositories, scientific publishers, data curators and archivists, and researchers willing to adopt the guidelines will benefit from a standardized approach to CURE-FAIR and what we hope will spur the development of widely-applicable solutions.

3.2 Plan for Engagement with Adjacent RDA Groups
The activities and final recommendations of the CURE-FAIR WG will complement the work of several RDA Working and Interest Groups that are focused on the standards and best practices that support computational reproducibility. Given the multitude of related activities ongoing within RDA working, interest groups, and affiliated organizations, our aim is not to duplicate efforts, but instead synthesize diverse recommended best practices and standards into an easy to use implementation guide. In addition, the majority of related Interest and Working groups address individual portions of the scientific workflow or technical infrastructure. Our aim will be to compile a broad range of surveyed practices and tested standards to address the reproducibility of the entirety of the scientific workflow, including related analysis software, data, and infrastructure components.
4. Work Plan
4.1 Final Recommendation
The final deliverable for the WG is a document outlining CURE-FAIR standards-based guidelines for best practices in publishing and archiving computationally reproducible studies, including the associated computational methods and materials.
4.2 Milestones and Deliverables
The group already met at the RDA 14th Plenary as a Birds-of-a-Feather, during which over 100 people gathered to explore the issues concerning curating for FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and reproducible data and code, reflecting the need to confront the challenges of supporting the reproducibility of scientific research. Participants identified as researchers, data support professionals, repository managers, publishers, IT support, and software developers. The discussion at the session has helped determine the focus of the working group going forward.
The WG Case Statement, drafted by the WG co-chairs, was shared for feedback at the RDA P15 and submitted to RDA for official consideration. We hope the group can be formalized before P16 in the Fall of 2020.
From the endorsement of the WG, we will complete the following,
3 months: Milestone 0: CURE-FAIR coordination with complementary WGs
Upon TAB endorsement of the CURE-FAIR WG, the WG will review the outputs and timelines of complementary WGs to coordinate the timing of CURE-FAIR WG activities and outputs with relevant WGs, particularly for those CURE-FAIR WG outputs that are dependent on the outputs of other WGs (or vice-versa).
The co-chairs will approach these WGs to establish productive working relationships and to understand how their activities and timelines affect the CURE-FAIR WG activities and milestones. This information will be used to produce a table displaying CURE-FAIR WG deliverables and finalized due dates alongside the deliverable dates of other RDA WGs outputs on which CURE-FAIR outputs are dependent.
6 months: Milestone 1: CURE-FAIR survey of current state presented at the Plenary
During the first six months of operation, the WG will bring together various stakeholders across the landscape to collect and examine existing practices and standards across disciplines related to reproduction and replication of computational research methods. During our groupÕs first plenary session at p16 as an authorized working group we will present a draft of existing work describing the current state of curating for reproducibility and the working groupÕs mid-term objectives to build upon this initial survey. We will also focus our first plenary session and the associated lead-time upon coordinating existing working group membership and recruiting new membership.
The WG will collect use cases, stories, and interviews with researchers trying to reproduce computational workflows to learn about any pain points, especially across domains. The goal is to have a holistic view of the issue from multiple stakeholder points of view, including researchers, data professionals, and technical infrastructure experts across research- domain and geographical boundaries.
Discipline specific practices will be synthesized to analyze the essential elements of reproducibility. Stakeholders of interest include but are not limited to research funders developing and enforcing policies, journals instituting policies for bolstering dissemination and storage of materials (Hrynaszkiewicz et al., 2020), third-party repositories supporting linkage of multiple scientific artifacts, and researchers implementing practices throughout their workflow. These stakeholders may be categorized into sub-groups or working group task forces--an approach shown to be successful previously in other working and interest groups in supporting effective and efficient group coordination and timely progress.
12 months: Milestone 2: CURE-FAIR practices synthesis presented at the Plenary
In the period between p16 and p17, working group members-including sub-groups/stakeholder task forces-will solicit and synthesize input from their representative communities about current practices in curating for computational reproducibility. Best practices will be categorized along key dimensions, including:
? Content descriptions (e.g., reproducible file bundle for social science experiments)
? Formats of data and software accepted
? Workflow descriptions
? Quality certifications
The interim document and categorization of best-practices will clarify the specific curation activities that extend traditional data curation best practices and support computational reproducibility. To support ease of use by various audiences, presentation of these best practices will be in both long-text form describing each practice and strategies for implementation, as well as a matrix categorizing CURE-FAIR curation practices.
18 months: Milestone 3: CURE-FAIR standards and guidelines presented at the Plenary
This final document will outline standards and guidelines for CURE-FAIR best practices in publishing and archiving computationally reproducible studies. We will aim to have representative adopters from each stakeholder sub-group who will implement these recommendations within their own workflows to assess barriers to implementation, needs for further enhancement, coordinated alignment with related stakeholder groups, and overall impact to enhancing the computational reproducibility of the published work.

4.3 Working Group Operations
In addition to meeting in person at plenaries, we will have two or more formal calls in between the plenaries and share information via a mailing list.
Documents will be created and made public through tools such as the Open Science Framework, Google docs, and Box. This allows for collaborative work and also serves as a form of communication. Those individuals actively working on outputs will have ad-hoc meetings as needed (e.g., Zoom). Trello and Github will be used for planning and tracking group deliverables.
4.4 Project Management
The WGÕs four co-chairs will share the responsibilities for exchanging ideas, updating the group on progress, and engaging with the community. Separate task groups will be formed to work on specific deliverables and will work on these between plenary sessions.
4.5 Community Engagement and Participation
Working group co-chairs and group members will conduct Interviews with active participants who are engaged in CURE and FAIR curation work. Our aim through these interviews is to both best understand community needs for best-practices, barriers to implementation, and increase public awareness of the RDA community and working group as a source for resources. We will aim to engage with aligned efforts across multiple domains, such as the ACM emerging interest group on Reproducibility and Independent Verification, the National Academies, National Libraries of Medicine, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
As described in the working group operations section above, project documentation and regular communication with WG members will be managed through open platforms and scheduled to accommodate multiple timezones. To increase openness and agreement of the final deliverable, working group members will be highly encouraged to participate in writing and editing of documents as well as reviewing feedback from adopters.
5. Adoption Plan
The individuals and institutions represented in this WG will endorse and adopt the CURE-FAIR standards-based guidelines to spur broader adoption by the academic community. This will be the first document produced by the academic community to establish the guidelines based on existing standards for curating for reproducible and FAIR research outputs across domains. The WG will engage with various stakeholders, including journals, institutions, data repositories, research labs, and others to formalize the guidelines. At a time when concerns about reproducibility are ubiquitous, community-wide adoption of this document will be a step toward a standardized approach to CURE-FAIR."
RDA/WDS Publishing Data Workflows WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rdawds-publishing-data-workflows-wg.html,yes,"Researchers are increasingly encouraged or required to make their research data available for reuse but might often feel there are insufficient incentives for submitting and publishing data, resulting in low submission rates. Moreover, even when research data are preserved and submitted, it often happens with a bare minimum of metadata which inhibits reuse.
Why is this? There are established and/or emerging workflows for selected disciplines that enable the publishing of data and some provide credit via citation mechanisms. But in most disciplines researchers are simply not aware of such workflows and they may not be applicable without significant modification. Having information about workflows is therefore crucial for researchersÑand the people/stakeholders supporting themÑto understand the options available to practice open science. Workflows that enable persistence, quality control and access are all crucial to enhance the possibilities for greater discoverability as well as efficient and reliable reuse of research data.
The objectives of this Working Group are to provide an analysis of a representative range of existing and emerging workflows and standards for data publishing, including deposit and citation,
2
and provide reference models and implementations for application in new workflows. We will report on:
? Investigation and classification of current workflows for publishing data - including a brief gap analysis across disciplines for the identified use cases.
? Identification of a smaller set of reference models covering a range of such workflows to include:
? when and where QA/QC and data peer-review fit into the publishing process (the broader subject of peer review itself is proposed as a future separate working group)
? the role of researchers, institutions, data centers, publishers, funders, service providers and the wider community in the data publishing process
? key barriers for identified use cases
? Selection of key use cases and organizations in which components of a reference model can be applied and promoted to the wider community, working closely with other WGs under the Publishing Data Interest Group.
We will build on the work of major past and current initiatives in which many of the working group members played leading roles. While these initiatives essentially focused on mature examples in particular in the Earth Sciences the work of this group will address a much more comprehensive and multi-disciplinary range of use cases, will classify workflow steps, components, and roles and eventually produce generic workflow models which towards the end of the project will be ready for testing and application in particular in the context of the ICSU World Data System and major science publishers.
Deliverables
? Provide a report summarizing the results of the investigation of current workflows including gap analysis
? A classification of a representative range of workflow models, in each case identifying the varying stakeholders and their different roles and responsibilities, to include where possible the likely associated resource and cost implications (working with relevant proposed RDA-WDS Costs of Publishing Data WG)
? Reference models summarizing key characteristics for each class of workflow
? Implementation of key components of a reference model to an existing use case(s) in order to illustrate the benefits to researchers and organizations of the reference model and the associated implications for the Working Groups on Costs, Publishing Services and Bibliometrics.
Value Proposition
Research communities and their institutions are consideringÑor in fewer cases are already implementingÑworkflows on their campuses or using platforms, such as discipline specific or national data centers, to allow their users to share and publish their research data. Many of them have to reinvent the wheel as there is no central resource or knowledge base to guide their efforts. Generic workflows, individual use cases or best practices for publishing data would aid them in establishing appropriate solutions that might include local systems enabling data deposit.
3
Research data are usually part of a network of scholarly objects, e.g. documentation, lab books or journal articles. It is expected that such clusters of information will continue to evolve and become more complex in the future as users expect to navigate seamlessly within them. They want to discover and access related information without major additional effort. This can only be facilitated by building a detailed understanding of the workflows and publishing outlets available right now. The main challenge will be identifying generic model elements while accounting for discipline specific features. We will cover different steps in the research lifecycle, as needed, e.g. from depositing data in repositories to dedicated data centers, data articles and journals. Identifying the steps in publishing workflows and who is responsible for various tasks can dispel some of the uneasiness for those encountering data publication for the first time as well as offer guidance across emerging and established tools being used in more advanced data sharing communities.
In classifying the current workflows, we will establish general models that allow for the individual imprints from various communities. The result will be reference models and components offering guidance for the wider community, from beginners to more advanced data publishers. This resource will be of use for any stakeholder group involved in publishing data. Repositories are often not aware of journal workflows and vice versa; understanding other parts of this complex endeavor helps each party see its role in the wider context. It is also useful in setting up mechanisms to link data and publications. Librarians have a role here in supporting researchers to find repositories to deposit in that are relevant both to their discipline and their publishing intentions, and offering guidance on the respective journal and repository workflows. The consortium of this working group comprises representatives of all these stakeholder groups to ensure the coverage of the wide range of use cases/best practices and viewpoints already emerging.
One important part of the work in the analysis of workflows will comprise the workflows for the usage of persistent identifiers, in particular Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), which enable persistent links between digital objects, as well as accurate data citation. Data publication that enables data citation is a key incentive to make data accessible. Furthermore, such persistent identifiers allow an interoperable framework across platforms, publishers, repositories and others.
We plan to build on this in the second phase to test real implementation(s) of generic workflow model components in new scenarios. This offers a mutual benefit for both the provider who can test applicability and promote awareness of tools and for those implementing new workflows and who become able to offer their communities the benefits of publishing data.
Who will benefit
The main beneficiaries of the analysis and subsequent testing provided by this working group are the researchers and the main stakeholders involved in publishing and managing data, as well as in supporting scholarly communication. Better services and strategies for joint workflows will consequently influences the wider research communities. Discoverability and reuse of data will be enhanced, in particular through the unique collaboration between all relevant service groups participating in this group.
Authors will have clear channels for publishing data available to them and, crucially, will be able to derive credit from adhering to best practice in managing and sharing their data. Funders will be able to track the research data they have funded, measure its impact and guard it against repetition. Researchers will be able to work faster and achieve deeper insights outside their immediate subject domain. Librarians and data center experts become an integral part of the
4
ecosystem, e.g. through their expertise in cataloguing and metadata production and reference models for workflows are templates for ingest, QA, archiving and dissemination. Publishers and other service providers can use reference models for linking data with publications and provide innovative solutions to enhance access to and analysis of the published data. Workflows for data and metadata exchange between the stakeholders who hold it will help policy makers, funders and the public better ensure that the data underpinning published research is being made accessible cost-effectively. Policy makers and the public will be able to navigate the knowledge landscape with increased confidence in its veracity.
Impact
After the first phases, the identified use cases referenced to generic model elements where appropriate, will allow for a unique assessment of data publishing workflows today. This will directly inform and influence the work of all participating stakeholder groups, from repository providers to journal editors. The first steps enable an information exchange beyond the individual stakeholder groups and thus enable the adoption of best practices from other disciplines or joint workflows.
The proposed test implementation(s) of generic workflow model components in new scenarios benefit providers and users as explained previously and enables communities to meet key international and national government mandates to enable and incentivize data sharing for the benefit of all.
Working closely with the associated RDA-WDS Publishing Data Working Groups proposed on Bibliometrics, Costs and Publishing Services, we will identify the role and implementation of emerging metrics and impact/assessment tools in our test workflows and disseminate best practice. This will further the advancement of data aware incentive systems in research.
Engagement with existing work in the area
The WG builds on existing initiatives that have already contributed to a better understanding of workflows across disciplines or institutions for example. In addition, a number of use cases have been identified for the work planned in the forthcoming 1.5 years. Many of the use cases presented below are committed to this working group.
This WG will concentrate on workflows specifically, but linked to the other proposed WGs. A general overview of relevant initiatives, projects, and platforms will be developed and maintained at the level of the RDA-WDS Publishing Data Interest Group, and may be found in the online survey1.
In addition, we have been provided with agreements to offer materials by the following stakeholders and will seek further contributions via ICSU-WDS Members and RDA. It is envisioned to expand into a range of disciplines, including further partners in the Humanities and Social Sciences.

FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-research-software-fair4rs-wg,yes,"One of the major challenges of data-driven research is to facilitate knowledge discovery by
assisting humans and machines in their discovery of, access to, integration and analysis of
data and their associated research objects, e.g., algorithms, software, and workflows. To
address this, an initial effort to define a ""DATA FAIRPORT""1 began in 2014 at the Lorentz
workshop and transitioned into developing a set of FAIR Data Guiding Principles2 in 2016.
The details of the FAIR data principles strongly contribute to addressing this challenge with
regard to research data. The principles, at a high level, are intended to apply to all research
objects; both those used in research and those that form the outputs of research. Here we
focus on the definition, adaptation and adoption of the FAIR principles for the case of
research software.
Software has become essential for research. To improve the findability, accessibility,
interoperability, and reuse of research software3, it is desirable to develop and apply a set of
FAIR Guiding Principles for software. Many of the high-level FAIR data principles can be
directly applied to research software by treating software and data as similar digital research
objects. However, specific characteristics of software Ñ such as its executability, composite
nature, and continuous evolution and versioning Ñ make it necessary to revise and extend
the original data principles.
Application of the FAIR principles to software will continue to advance the aims of the open
science movement. The FAIR For Research Software Working Group (FAIR4RS WG) will be
jointly convened as an RDA Working Group, FORCE11 Working Group, and Research
Software Alliance (ReSA) Taskforce , in recognition of the importance of this work for the
advancement of the research sector.
FAIR4RS WG will enable coordination and leverage existing community-led discussions on
how to define and effectively apply FAIR principles to research software, to achieve adoption
of these principles. The working group will deliver:
- A document developed with community support defining FAIR principles for research
software
- A document providing guidelines on how to apply the FAIR principles for research
software (based on existing frameworks)
- A document summarising the definition of the FAIR principles for research software,
implementation guidelines and adoption examples.

RDA FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) Case Statement
July 2020 1
2. Value Proposition
FAIR4RS WG will define FAIR principles for research software and identify practical means
of achieving them.
This work will be of value to software project owners, researchers, users of research data
and software, the scientific community, research software engineers, software developers
who publish their software, software catalogue maintainers, repository managers, software
preservation and archival experts, policymakers who are responsible for defining digital
policies, and organisations that create, modify, manage, share, protect, and preserve
research software, funders of research, and others with an interest in the FAIR principles for
research software.
FAIR4RS WG will provide a range of ways for community members to engage. All
community members will receive regular updates through the RDA email list . The email list
will facilitate collaborations through invitations to webinars, collaborative documents,
surveys, etc. All documentation produced by the group will be publicly accessible via
collaborative documents. Community members are able to engage at any of the three levels:
? Steering committee. The steering committee is responsible for leadership of the WG.
? Working and feedback cohort. Community members can choose to engage with the
WG by providing feedback at their preferred pace via the WG RDA space , subgroup
activities and the WG GitHub repo .
? Advocates. Those who can play a key role in endorsing and promoting the outcomes
of this group.
3. Engagement with existing work in the area
The FAIR4RS WG emerged from the Ò FAIR for research software Ó session at VP15, run by
the Software Source Code IG along with authors of the position paper ÒTowards FAIR
Principles for Research SoftwareÓ https://doi.org/10.3233/DS-190026 . This group brings
together and builds on a wide range of work internationally; notably the SSC IG activity at
P13 and events within the ELIXIR community. Other key community publications and events
involving AGU, ARDC, CLARIAH, CODATA, DANS, ELIXIR, EOSC FAIR WG, FAIRsFAIR,
FAIRsharing, GO-FAIR, Netherlands eScience Center, ReSA, SSI, Software Heritage and
TIB are included in the following list4:
4 Further details on these initiatives are contained in Software Source Code IG wiki VP15, 2020.
RDA FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) Case Statement
July 2020 2
Members of these groups have been collaborating with FAIR4RS WG, and the adoption plan
for the WG outcomes will continue this work. We will bring in other organisations as
appropriate, such as US Research Software Sustainability Institute (URSSI), Workshop on
Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences ( WSSSPE), Software
Preservation Network (SPN), Software Heritage, Software Sustainability Institute (SSI),
Society of Research Software Engineering, CodeMeta, in addition to other national and
disciplinary initiatives.
The significance of this work is illustrated by the convening of FAIR4RS WG across RDA,
FORCE11 and ReSA. FORCE11 is a community of scholars, librarians, archivists,
publishers and research funders that has arisen organically to help facilitate the change
toward improved knowledge creation and sharing. ReSAÕs vision is to see research software
recognised and valued as a fundamental and vital component of research worldwide. ReSA
leads a number of taskforces that assist in achieving these aims. This new FAIR4RS WG will
be jointly convened as an RDA WG, a FORCE11 WG, and a taskforce of ReSA.
RDA groups
FAIR4RS WG will also engage with a range of other RDA WGs whose interests overlap, and
ensure that the work of the WG aligns with the work of the other groups. We have a
commitment to engage with co-chairs of relevant RDA groups and we would like to extend
an invitation to the members of the following groups to check regularly our public updates via
the mailing list archive .
? CURE FAIR WG - f ocusing on the reproducibility aspect of FAIR for data and code.
? SSC IG - provides a forum to discuss issues on management, sharing, discovery,
archival and provenance of software source code. It pays special attention to source
code that generates research data and plays an important role in scientific
publications. FAIR4RS is proposed to be a WG of the SSC IG.
? SCID WG - bringing together a broad panel of stakeholders directly involved in
software identification and planning an output with concrete recommendations for the
academic community to ensure that the solutions that will be adopted by the
RDA FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) Case Statement
July 2020 3
academic players are compatible with each other and especially with the software
development practice of tens of millions of developers worldwide.
? FAIR data maturity model - working on RDA recommendations for a common set of
core assessment criteria for FAIRness and a generic and expandable
self-assessment model for measuring the maturity level of a dataset.
Other potential groups to coordinate with include: Go FAIR IG , Exposing Data Management
Plans WG , Active Data Management Plans IG , Research Funders and Stakeholders on
Open Research Data Management Policies and Practices IG , Research Metadata Schemas
WG , and Global Open Research Commons IG .
4. Work Plan
The WG aims at defining FAIR for research software, and identifying guidelines on how to
apply the FAIR principles for research software. Note that while the group is interested in
FAIR metrics and indicators for research software, this is not in scope for this WG. We
suggest this could be an activity for a follow-on group. We also like to emphasise that with
the early definition of a 'steering committee' to coordinate the work the deliverables are
attainable in a timeline of 18 months from endorsement.

FAIR4RS WG will define principles for FAIR for Research Software, then guidelines and
practices for their widespread adoption across the research software community at national,
disciplinary, and international levels. The WG will organise dissemination about the activities
and findings and gather community feedback regularly during all the phases of the work. To
promote transparency and accessibility of work in progress, the group members will utilise a
public Google Drive collaborative working folder (through ReSA) and a GitHub repository
(through FORCE11) for WG collaborative documents. The following table details the
engagement that will be undertaken towards relevant milestones, including final adoption.
Milestone Engagement
1 Identify issues in definition of
FAIR for research software,

After gathering adoption examples from the
community, the Steering Committee will draft a set
of adoption guidelines, which will be circulated and
validated with the community.
6 Implement plan for adoption of
guidelines, which will continue
after the cessation of this WG.
The adoption plan will address how to work with
different stakeholders, including:
? those that will endorse and promote the
guidelines
? those that will provide training on the
guidelines
? users of the guidelines
? and will include suggestions on follow-up
work
The convening of this WG across RDA, FORCE11, and ReSA will support usage of the
outcomes across those communities. RDA, FORCE11, and ReSA will systematically
promote the outcomes, aiming to raise awareness and facilitate a wider adoption of the
Working Group outcomes by existing and emerging initiatives. Organisations with a focus on
FAIR will also be engaged, to encourage promotion of the application of FAIR to research
outputs other than data."
Blockchain Applications in Health WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/blockchain-applications-health-wg,yes,"The Health Data IG is sponsoring the idea of establishing a WG focusing on Blockchain in Health data, as a technological advanced solution for securing data sharing among clinical institutions and individuals.
Simply stated, the blockchain is a cryptographic protocol which makes it possible to run a distributed, public and trustable ledger where transactions referring to digital objects are signed with issuer and recipientÕs identities, verified by a community of peers and stored as incremental ÒblocksÓ into a shared database. Beyond technicalities, the true disruption of the blockchain lies in the fact that it brings digital trust over a potentially un-trustable network. It can make Trusted Third Party-centred systems obsolete by giving decision-making powers to data subjects and clinical institutions.
The large scale deployment of a blockchain ledger can, in fact, enable health data transactions based (when needed) on the appropriate patientÕs consent and/or the hospitalÕs permission and operated through self-enacting smart contracts, in combination with a catalogue of all available data, which would be browsable at anytime, anywhere and by anyone, yet containing no sensitive information.
The aim of establishing a dedicated WG is:
¥	to analyse and compare usages of the blockchain in healthcare, implementations of blockchain architectures, associated legal and socio-economic impacts and perspectives
¥	to assess the potential of blockchain-based self-enacting smart contracts in handling consent and data permission systems minimising transaction costs
¥	to assess whether and how the blockchain can ensure compliance with advanced data protection requirements (such as those defined by the EU General Data Protection Regulation Ð GDPR), yet making it happen seamlessly and efficiently, at scale.
Within 18 months of activity, starting from concrete examples, the group will draw a set of use-cases, thus feeding a working draft and concluding on good practices, technical recommendations, and guidance to healthcare professionals interested in having recourse to blockchain solutions.
 
 
2. Value Proposition
Imagine a place where individuals, research centres, pharma companies, and healthcare professionals can easily search for and mobilise on demand large volumes of data while ensuring at all times patientsÕ clear consents and the highest standards of privacy protection and security, coping with any hurdle deriving from geographical location, data complexity, or data protection laws.
The blockchain can help to establish a solid technological backbone, supporting healthcare information systemsÕ resilience, and acting as an operational data protection regulation-compliant infrastructure, where data transactions are informed and controlled by informational self-determination and privacy-by-design/default principles.
The guidelines produced as WGÕs outcome shall benefit all kind of stakeholders dealing with health data who require full traceability of data usage especially for research purposes, and who will benefit from transparency and trust, such as: biomedical researchers, clinicians, drug and device trials operators, individual patients wishing to know more about other people sharing similar medical conditions, as well as individuals/patients/citizens willing to make use of trustful blockchain-based systems for contributing to data sharing to enhance scientific research and medical knowledge.

3. Engagement with existing work in the area
the case statement is missing any summary of work done outside the proposed RDA WG or any mention of external groups
(at least one presentation by a French expert and project in this area was made at a BoF in 2017, so the external work should be noted and an explanation of how it relates to the proposed WG should be stated)
Text on either why no other external groups or organizations are active in this area or they should be described and consulted/included (some of the WG members may well be representatives of such external work, but their expertise or activities are not provided)
The WG on Blockchain applications in Health will be directly associated with the Health Data IG, and it will seek cooperation with all groups interested in applying blockchain to other areas, such as the Ethics and Social Aspects of Data IG or the Working Group for Data Security and Trust (WGDST), as well as any group interested in the future in better understanding the blockchain potential by clustering with the Blockchain applications in the Health WG.
Two very high-level presentations were given by blockchain experts during the two BoFs on ÒHealth Data and BlockchainÓ held at RDA P9 in Barcelona and RDA P10 in Montreal. The first presentation in Barcelona was by Prof. Aggelos Kiayias (chair in Cyber Security and Privacy at the University of Edinburgh and Associate Professor of Cryptography and Security at the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens) and focused on ÒBlockchain solutions and PrivacyÓ; the second one in Montreal by David Manset (CEO of gnœbila and Head of R&I Almerys) described an example of a blockchain system (still under construction) applied to health.
Furthermore, RDA Europe promoted within the RDA Innovation Forum in Bruxelles (30th January 2018) a session on ÒOpportunities to shape future data research - blockchain and what is it for and what notÓ, focusing on the opportunities and limitations related to Blockchain Technology applied to Scientific Data and based on the suggestions coming from the paper ÒBlockchain and DataÓ by Wittenburg and Kuchinke (2017). Speakers invited to the session were: Peter Wittenburg (Max Planck Society), ÒShort Introduction of Blockchain and its possible role in IoT data tradingÓ; Edwin Morley-Fletcher (Lynkeus) on ÒApplying blockchain in Health sectorÓ; Monique Morrow (Humanized Internet) on ÒProviding Self-Verification Capabilities via BlockchainÓ; and Visa Vallivaara (VTT) on ÒApplying blockchain to increase trust in AIÓ.
Outside the RDA, several on-going projects and initiatives confirm the rising interest for blockchain within the Health sector and the need to facilitate the establishment of a wide community of users, utilising the blockchain system for data exchange, data valorisation, data access, and product development.
Blockchain technologies can create an own ecosystem with own rules and processes when applied comprehensively; but this is still in discussion. Therefore, a WG is necessary that can discuss the disruptive potential as well as the novelty and efficiency of Blockchain solutions as potential game changers in health research.
While members of the proposed WG are already involved in some H2020 EU-funded projects dealing with blockchain and Health data (such as myhealthmydata, using blockchain technology to secure health data transactions) networking shall be pursued with already existing communities in the intersection between healthcare, health data management, and blockchain, such as the Hashed Health Collective, the Hyperledger Fabric Foundation (specifically in the healthcare domain), the Decentralised Identity Foundation, the European Institute for Innovation through Health Data, and the CONFIDENCE  bench pilot consortium. Further efforts will be devoted to interacting with on-going initiatives in the field, such as MedicalChain, Datum, Ocean, the EU-funded project Privacy Flag, TrustedHealth, just to mention a few, and to connect with a number of existing industrial platforms such as the FraunhoferÕs Industrial Data Space, Combient and Siemens Healthineers Digital Ecosystem.
 
 
4. Work Plan
?	The final deliverable of the WG will be a set of Guidelines for establishing a scalable blockchain-based data sharing system in healthcare. These guidelines will include a state-of-the-art report and a report on regulatory and legal issues, focussing on blockchain applications in health.
?	At 6 months interval, 3 reports will be presented at each RDA Plenary WGÕs Session, highlighting the performed analysis and activities, following 3 steps: first, the state-of-the-art report (after 6 months) describing the current experiences in blockchain based handling of health data; second, the report on regulatory and legal issues (after 12 months); third, the comprehensive Guidelines on Blockchain applications in Health (after 18 months), inclusive also of an example of basic coding for a health-data blockchain architecture (example of basic coding to be outlined in more detail), such as allowing clinical institutions to register their datasets in the blockchain and make them available to users; for these to browse available data and apply analytics to the federated data repository; for individuals and clinical institutions to define consent, data access rights, and monitor the use of their data; for data to be accessed and downloaded by authorised data users through the blockchain.
?	From the start of the WG, its members will be asked to join one or more of the proposed sub-groups
?	Working documents will be made public or accessible to WG/RDA members via open tools such as Google docs.
?	Over a period of one and a half year, the working group will host a general 2-hour telco on a quarterly basis and meet in person every six months at the RDA Plenary Assembly. Smaller groups, dedicated to the above-mentioned reports, will communicate on-line at least on a monthly basis.
?	The WG members will work individually or in small groups depending on the activities to be performed in relation to the above-mentioned WG outcomes. Activities assigned, and draft outcomes will be discussed, monitored and reviewed during the quarterly telcos and Plenary sessions, and additional TCs will be organized when needed.
?	The WG Guidelines will be reported to the Health Data IG so that HDIG members may share and disseminate them in all relevant events they will happen to attend.
.
The adoption plan is missing (for how the outcoming recommendations will ultimately be used outside of the RDA)
5. Adoption Plan
In view of disseminating the Guidelines outside the RDA community, the members of the WG are expected to present the outcoming recommendations in relevant events or in their work environment, or in any useful event they may occur to participate.
Additionally, RDA national nodes will be addressed to gain support for disseminating the Guidelines and other outputs or recommendations resulting from the WG.
Connections and networks established through the above-mentioned initiatives and with relevant stakeholders (see point 3) will provide the opportunity to present and discuss the Guidelines to a wider community, involving it in the revision and adoption process.
Furthermore, relevant on-going projects may benefit of the Guidelines with regard to their activities."
Reproducible Health Data Services WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/reproducible-health-data-services-wg,yes,"The goal of the working group is to enhance the reuse of health data for research and improve the FAIRness of aggregated and curated data sets for secondary use by providing recommendations to enhance the reproducibility of data curation services.
Processes of health data curation are often conducted by data service providers within centers of health informatics, health data brokerage, or health statistics, all such centers we aim to include in the ambit of Òhealth data servicesÓ. Examples of health data services include: health data curation centers, medical data services, clinical data integration centers, biostatistics and system medicine institutes, and other data centers who assimilate, manage, and distribute health data for various primary and secondary uses such as research, innovation, quality assurance and improvement, and efficiency monitoring. Health data services facilitate the use and reuse of data in different contexts surrounding health care and health research. The data span across biomedical domains, including clinical, genomic, and patient generated health data repositories. The actors involved in health data services perform many tasks such as data curation, mapping, integration, and publishing. These interdependent tasks build upon each other to create workflows that transform siloed data into new, curated datasets, requiring the navigation of data interoperability, data quality, and data security. Thus, understanding these health services processes is vital to support reproducibility and ensure FAIR data practices.
The case statement outlines our work and provides the focus and the boundaries for the working group activities.
The following stakeholders will potentially benefit from our contribution:
- Data curators/brokers in their daily activities
- Data consumers (e.g., clinical researcher, application developers, innovators)
- Health research data repositories or archivists
- Health research funders
The benefits may include the ability to reuse processes, gain credit for work, provide transparency, and facilitate machine readable workflows pertaining to the collection, cleaning, and curation of health data for analysis and sharing.
The RDA Reproducible Data Services Working Group (i) will provide recommendations to identify, capture, and store metadata documenting workflows for collecting and curating health data for
2
secondary reuse, and (ii) will develop an adoption and training guide to improve the uptakes of our outputs.
Value Proposition
Biomedical data are valuable resources for multiple purposes beyond the original collection context. Yet, the data reside in distributed repositories in various forms (e.g., written reports, structured data, semi-structured data such as genomic tests, and imaging). Additionally, due to privacy reasons and high barriers to communication with local systems, most biomedical data curation is handled via health data services. These services receive data requests and deliver the curated data set. While there might be internal mechanisms to record data provenance, there is no explicit, standardized method to describe and document the processes for collecting and preparing secondary data for reuse within the health sciences.
Processes such as finding, selecting, and integrating the data for a given research question or clinical decision support pathway requires a set of data curation activities including data access, query, extraction, transformation, cleaning, aggregation, and sharing. Each of these steps impacts the scope and coverage of the resulting curated data set.
For reproducible research, the research data curation workflow should be clearly documented, if possible in a machine interpretable way, and should be accessible beyond the lifetime of the data curation process. However, current documentation practices primarily stem from processes generated for the need of each lab, department, or research project, with little attention paid to the interoperability of the final data with appropriate research repositories, or the capture of the entire research workflow. For example, in the case of pathology, paper and digital reports containing the interpretation of samples and data vary widely, including what information ought to be documented, what terminology is used for interpreting pathology status, the sectioning and order of information in the document, and the final data type of textual data stored in the medical record. Adjudicating these variances in clinical interpretations and data nuances is left to the researchers and data brokers collecting and preparing the data for re-use. These same variances and nuances witnessed in textual pathology reports can be observed in almost every type of clinical observation and health data, such as the clinical ontology used for documenting a disease, the manner in which lab tests are coded and timestamped, or whether drugs in a participant record are ordered, administered in hospital, or prescribed for home use. All of these distinctions matter when attempting to study and generalize findings to particular disease types, cohorts of patient sub-groups, the efficacy of particular drugs or treatment regimens, and etc. Thus, the Reproducible Health Data Services WG aims to generate a machine-readable method for documenting these data nuances and the manner in which they are curated and adjudicated within a final research data set.
Implementation of the WG recommendations will improve the capture and storage of salient metadata elements documenting - in a machine processable way wherever possible - data provenance and curation activities, thus contributing to the overall FAIRness of the data and project as a whole. The projected use case of the final deliverable will allow Data consumers
3
(researchers, innovators, etc.) to access detailed data curation metadata together with the data itself. This documented and machine actionable metadata will enable reproducible research and improve data quality.
Multiple ongoing research initiatives across the biomedical sciences demonstrate the need for such a metadata standard for the documentation of data curation workflows.
For instance, within the United States, the National Academies of Science and Engineering have hosted multiple expert workshops aimed to define the best-practices of transparent reporting and appropriate stakeholder support and incentives to achieve reproducible workflows. The development, implementation, and testing of our working groupÕs deliverables would allow for increased transparency, interoperability, and reproducibility across such government-funded projects.
Members of the EU lead Fair4Health and HL7 FHIR initiatives have also expressed the need for such a schema to document the data provenance, curation activities, and associated research workflow materials (including query scripts and code) for the clinical trial data they aim to merge within a central repository.
National projects such as Germany Medical Informatics Initiative
(https://www.medizininformatik-initiative.de/en/about-initiativ e) creates data integration centers to aggregate research and healthcare data and share. Similar projects across the social sciences, agriculture, and humanities wherein collection and secondary use of data is relevant could benefit from lessons learned throughout the development and implementation of the deliverable developed within our groupÕs work.
Engagement with existing work in the area:
This work will be directly associated with the Health Data IG. We will also collaborate with the following IG/WG to optimize our work:
? Working Group for Data Security and Trust (WGDST)
? WDS/RDA Assessment of Data fitness for Use WG
? RDA/CODATA Legal Interoperability IG
? RDA/NISO Privacy Implications of Research Data Sets IG
? Ethics and Social Aspects of Data IG
? PID Kernel Information WG
? Reproducibility IG
? Metadata Standards WG
? Metadata IG
? PID IG
? PID Kernel WG
? Data Foundations Terminology IG
? Research Data Provenance IG
? RDA WG Guidelines for FAIR data policies (pending)
4
In addition to collaborating with existing working and interest groups, we will leverage relationships with the RDA Secretariat and OAB to increase the representation and engagement of perspectives from the community of potential adopters, particularly targeting data brokers, curators, and clinical data warehouse managers within academia, government, and industry.
Outside of RDA:
? Non-Profit/NGOÕs focused on biomedical data, including epidemiology, public, and global health groups, in addition to international groups focused upon increasing the
reproducibility and transparency of secondary data use in the health sciences
? Academic and governmental medical institutions. Co-chairs and members of the working group have ties to academic and governmental medical institutions with large clinical data warehouses regularly used to support clinical research.
? Industry: solution providers for health care IT
Final Deliverables
1. Recommendation Statement for Reproducible Health Data-Services:
Reviewing and documentation of existing standards which can potentially capture data curation provenance; identifying gaps within current health data services practices producing limitations in study reproducibility and transparency; recommendations for future standard development activities.
2. Adoption and Training Guide:
Document state-of-the-art methods and standards for clinical data curation; best practices for capturing and storing data curation metadata for reproducible research. The final recommendation statement will demonstrate protocols for documenting the data, materials, and processes essential for reproducing the collection, cleaning, assessment, and sharing of health data as executed within health data service centers.
Milestones and Intermediate Documents
Documents will be created and made public through tools such as the Open Science
Framework, Google docs, GitHub, B2Share, and the RDA Website. From the start of the WG, we will complete the following:
6 months Feedback on initial workflow draft:
Feedback will be collected through presentations, meetings, and workshops with data brokerage teams and clinical researchers who lead or participate with such teams, in essence the primary adoption audience. In addition, use case examples, feedback will be garnered through broad international meetings and conferences providing both online and in person critique of and contribution to developing workflow. To broaden online engagement and limit barriers to participation, feedback and use cases will be garnered through github commits and comments - similar to the maDMP common standards WG- online web forums within the RDA website and plenaries, open public working group meetings and calls, as well as online through open google documents and notes. Key feedback concerns will
5
include the generalizability, granularity, and comprehensiveness of the proposed metadata standard, as well as any potential risks or barriers to adoption that ought to be overcome throughout development and testing. Feedback will be documented and adjudicated by members of the Reproducible Health Data Services WG, edits will be made to the existing metadata templates, and metrics based upon these concerns will be developed in preparation for gap analysis and use case tests.
12 months Gap analysis completed and test cases will be identified:
Test use cases will ingest materials and data generated through completed or ongoing health data brokerage projects.
Metrics of success will include the following:
1) Completeness of data ingest within an institutional metadata database, capturing metadata describing complete project workflows.
2) Ease of usability, gathered through interviews with teams participating in test cases; The aim of this metric would be to provide an evaluation metric to support uptake by the targeted community of use.
3) Cleanliness of data held in institutional metadata databases and the feasibility of extracting, transforming, and loading data captured in the metadata repository into existing domain and publisher metadata repositories, thus providing further linkage to additional project metadata documentation within external repositories, such as NCBI, PubMed, or ClinicalTrials.gov
18 months Use case presented at RDA Plenary:
Presentations will take the form of working group session interactive talks, posters, and panels. Feedback from plenary group attendees will be adjudicated by WG team members and adapted within preparation for workflow completion and adoption.
12-18 months Complete workflow and prepare for future adoption:
Mode and Frequency of Communication
In addition to meeting at plenaries, we will have two or more formal calls in between the plenaries. Using on-line collaborative tools (e.g. Google docs, OSF) will allow for work and comments will also serve as a form of communication. Those individuals actively working on outputs will have ad-hoc meetings as needed (e.g., Skype). Trello and Github will be used for planning and tracking group deliverables.
Develop Consensus
The chairs and active members will work together in a small-group to achieve the goals. When there is a draft output, this will be presented to the larger group through a publicized call for anyone to attend, as well as through community events such as the RDA plenaries, regular working group meetings, webinars, and international conferences workshops. As mentioned in
6
the 6 month ÒFeedback on initial workflow draftÓ section, online, virtual, and in person channels will be initiated and maintained to provide avenues for raising concerns or monitoring consensus, or lack thereof.
Broader Community Engagement and Participation
The developed deliverables will be discussed in multiple networks across Europe, North America, South America, Africa, and Australia, including GoFAIR, German Medical Informatics Initiative, and meetings of HL7 FHIR working groups. Currently, a collaborative working group within HL7 FHIR is being developed, titled RDA WG Guidelines for FAIR data policies, utilizing multiple aspects of the Reproducible Health Data Services concepts and will provide a method for testing adoption of the WG deliverables. The online, virtual, and in-person modes of engaging community developed within the 6 months milestone will be continued throughout the lifespan of the project. These channels will be monitored by working group co-chairs and concerns about barriers to engagement will be addressed as much as possible, including by opening new channels of community engagement as necessary if and when concerns are raised.
Planned Activities Review of the workflow components and related challenges
? Define the processes of moving data through a clinical data service center and break down into a set of possible data service activities in a workflow.
? Identify challenges for each curation activity from the perspective of reproducible research.
? Identify the possible metatypes for each curation activity to trace the data provenance.
Perform a Gap analysis to identify the supporting metadata standards:
? Survey and map existing standards and recommendations supporting data provenance in each curation activity step.
? Map the curation steps with reproducibility assessment frameworks (such as RepeAT)
? Identify gaps and document suggestions for future standardization efforts.
Adoption and Training Guideline:
? First adoption will be implemented by Stanford CEDAR project. See the adoption plan below. The projection is that testing within the CEDAR repository will be scalable to similar institutional metadata repositories across medical informatics cores and clinical data warehouses.
? Other adoption use cases will be explored both among group members. Stakeholders who have expressed interest in participating in such adoption include German Medical Informatics Initiative, GoFAIR, eResearch Services at multiple university medical informatics cores.
Adoption Plan:
Reproducible Health Data Services Metadata Model:
7
Documentation of workflow best practices will be shared as a data dictionary of materials to be collected, stored, and shared throughout the data brokerage process and FAIR principles for each piece of materials. This data dictionary will be developed into RDF and JSON metadata schemas. These schema will then be integrated and deployed within the a metadata registry tool, which will provide an interface for data entry, storage, and export, as well as a display of the existing metadata standards and ontologies mapped to each element within the Reproducible Health Data Service Workflow.
While the initial test of the outputÕs implementation will be built within the CEDAR infrastructure, the final metadata schema will be developed and disseminated in the form of JSON and RDF schemas to support broad community collaboration and scalable implementation within similar metadata and data repositories, as well as integration or alignment with external repositories, such as clinicaltrials,gov, pubmed, and scholarly publication infrastructures. In addition to sharing metadata collection templates through CEDAR, the final deliverable will be hosted and shared on a project Github, Open Science Framework, shared Google drive, and the RDA website.
Adoption Guide:
An adoption guide will be created to assist adopters in the use of the metadata collection templates, as well as best practices associated with collecting, storing, and sharing each element within the Reproducible Health Data Service Workflow. This adoption guide will also be made available within a project Github, Open Science Framework, and shared Google drive, and potentially disseminated in the form of a publication.
The primary audience for community output adoption includes project managers of clinical data warehouses, health data registries, and clinical research investigators/teams who regularly interact with clinical data brokers. Metrics of successful adoption include:
? Training of clinical data warehouse staff in reproducibility best practices using the disseminated adoption guide;
? Successful collection and ingest of metadata about workflows generated by projects satisfying the elements within the reproducible health data service workflow framework;
? Implementation and adaptation of adoption guide and/or framework into existing clinical data management"
Raising FAIRness in health data and health research performing organisations (HRPOs) WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/raising-fairness-health-data-and-health-research-performing-organisations-hrpos-wg,yes,"Reuse of health and clinical research data (including social care, and hereafter referred to as health
research data) has major restrictions when compared to other research data in the biomedical
domain. This primarily pertains to the concerns imposed by privacy, sensitivity and ethical issues
raised by making data freely available. Meanwhile, research data management (RDM) practices such
as the creation of data management plans (DMP), sharing datasets, the deposition of data in
repositories, and the application of FAIR data principles to research outcomes are becoming
increasingly common as they are required by funder mandates. Besides this requirement placed by
funders there is also the wider need for researchers to share, find and access data to progress
common goals as the primary value, and promote integrity and reproducibility.
The last few years have seen a rapid rise in uptake of the FAIR principles, which originated in the life
sciences domain, but which have now been adopted to varying degrees across all research domains.
Concomitant with the rise of FAIR datasets has been an increase in open research which urges
researchers to make their data available for reuse, especially those that are publicly funded. However,
an important caveat when thinking about FAIR when compared to open research is the phrase Òas
open as possible, as closed as necessaryÓ .
The recent enforcement of the GDPR in Europe is a prime example of a legal framework that makes
strict regulations around the processing and sharing of personal data and places the onus on the data
controller to make sure provisions are in place to ensure this. Although the GDPR is the most far
reaching data protection legislation currently in the world, there are other territories that have
restrictions on secondary use of personal data and health data, e.g. USA (HIPAA), Ireland (Health
Research Regulation), India (Personal Data Protection Bill) and S-Africa (Protection of Personal
Information Act). As well as internationally enforced restrictions, there are those at national and local
levels, and together they all require evidence that the sharing and reuse of health research data are
carried out responsibly and in-line with stated aims. The legislation is not meant to impose barriers but
to protect individuals' rights.
FAIR adoption in the health research domain is complicated by numerous factors including concerns
regarding: ethical, moral, cultural, technical, and legal constraints of primary source data. We
therefore propose this WG to address some of these issues to:
? Analyse and report legal and ethical issues surrounding data privacy of health research data
at the national level.
? Identify commonalities across territories that can be a foundation for harmonisation of
guidelines on FAIR adoption.
? Provide Health Research Performing Organizations (HRPOs) with a set of clear and simple
guidelines for implementing FAIR Open Data policy in health research.
Therefore, the main purpose of this WG is to provide HRPOs (such as universities, public research
institutes, hospitals, medical charities etc.) with a set of clear and simple guidelines, which will define,
establish and enable implementation of an aligned FAIR data policy at the institutional level. At this
time, there is a lack of clear and practical instructions for HRPOs to implement the FAIR principles
locally. By developing clear guidelines, HRPO researchers will be better equipped to share and drive
reuse of their datasets alongside non-health research, having previously obtained approvals from
Ethics Committees, when necessary. This last point is particularly important since the variables are
hitherto unknown for innovation in unexpected fields of research outwith health research.
The target audience for the proposed WG guidelines (beyond HRPOs themselves) are primarily
researchers. In health research, researchers (and physicians) will be the responsible individuals
tasked with implementing established policies of their data. Moreover, senior management will also be
involved in shaping and driving these policies. In both cases, there is evidence that these individuals
have little or no prior knowledge of FAIR and other technical issues, which is still the case in other
research domains too1. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that these same individuals are the
most willing to implement FAIR practices in their research institutions where possible and practicable.
To achieve our stated objectives, the following tasks will be undertaken:
? Perform a landscape analysis to inform the guidelines.
? Invite specific stakeholders to help draft the guidelines, aiming for diversity in regional
representation.
? Disseminate the draft guidelines to a wider community and agree a final version.
? Devise an outreach strategy so that the guidelines can be adopted by the intended
community.
To underpin the drafting of the guidelines, the WG will draw upon a comprehensive analysis of current
barriers (technical, ethical, security, legal, cultural, behavioural and economic), factors that reinforce
them and potential overcoming mechanisms, which was and is currently investigated further by the
EU H2020 funded FAIR4Health (F4H) project2. This WG will also build upon previous BoFs, held in
RDA Plenary 13 and Plenary 14, initiated by F4H, about the necessity for creating useful and
straightforward FAIR guidelines for HRPOs. Attendance at RDA 13 was the first time where this
specific issue was discussed and the need for a dedicated WG was raised, and we were able to bring
together a diverse group of interested individuals as well as establish contact with founders and
members of the Health Research Data IG. The RDA 14 BoF built upon this.
Together, the proposed aims will be used to formulate an RDA approved output. The WG will take as
its starting point 5 principles and 10 steps derived from a recently completed deliverable3 in F4H, and
further refine them through the course of its work to ensure they are fit for purpose for HRPOs to
implement a FAIR data policy globally. They take into account all the legal, ethical, cultural and
technical challenges that need to be overcome.
2. Value Proposition A specific description of who will benefit from the adoption or implementation of the WG
outcomes and what tangible impacts should result.
The main beneficiaries of these results are those that are responsible and have the authority to
establish policies in HRPOs globally, the researchers themselves, and societal outcomes. For the
latter, adoption of these guidelines will aid transparency since health research can be opaque in many
circumstances. This will require engagement of patientsÕ groups, medical charities and public
research institutions, as well as drawing from the growing field of citizen science. Moreover, there will
be beneficiaries outwith the health research domain that will be able to access such data where

allowable to foster innovation in, for example, technology. The results of the implementation of the
FAIR data policy gathered in this WG will allow facilitation and encouragement of the HRPO
community to share and reuse their datasets derived from publicly funded research initiatives.
The potential impact of the proposed FAIR data policy, in terms of health outcomes and health
research, will be:
? adoption policy is expected to have a beneficial impact on science (sharing and reuse of
health research results), the economy (optimisation of resources) and society (alignment of
health outcomes with the values, needs and societal outcomes).
? increase visibility of international FAIR data policies and the applicable research data which
has the potential to be reused.
? increased awareness by outreach to HRPOs to use FAIR and to be as open as possible
through public engagement and deliberation for the health research community, data
scientists, industry, and general public. This will be based on existing and ongoing work being
conducted by the F4H project.
3. Engagement with existing work in the area A brief review of related work and plan for engagement with
any other activities in the area.
Better definition of the FAIR principles to different research domains and resource types, in a practical
sense and including applying metrics to FAIRness levels, is currently being examined by a number of
international consortia. These will be leveraged to inform the guidelines that will be delivered by this
WG. Some consortia and work that are known so far include:
? FAIR4Health
? GO FAIR
? EOSC (-Life) and the Turning FAIR into Reality WG related to EOSC-Life project
? FAIRplus
? FAIRsFAIR
? Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe, provides legislative drivers such as the newly revised EU

Some of the above groups have already been approached by F4H and there is ongoing engagement
to address concerns. These have included teleconferences and attendance at fora organised by
respective groups. Further engagement with these and other initiatives will be to facilitate the inclusion
and participation of HRPOs to ensure that research outcomes are shared, and FAIR data policy
strategies are useful for the diverse needs of these institutions.
4. Work Plan A specific and detailed description of how the WG will operate including:
? The form and description of the final Recommendation of the WG,
The RDA Recommendation from the WG will be titled Guidelines for implementing FAIR data within
Health Research Producing Organisations. The Recommendation will be provided in a
non-proprietary, open file format. It will include the following components:
? Guidelines for HRPO senior managers on how to write a FAIR aligned data policy for their
organisation, to enable the reuse of health research data.
? Guidelines for health researchers working within HRPOs on publicly funded research on how
to make their data FAIR in a practical sense. This will be a longer document with links to
supporting resources and references to best practice examples of FAIR health data.
? A checklist and/or rubric that can assist data creators within HRPOs to make their data FAIR.
This will be a short and concise document that will allow researchers to quickly check their
data against a specific FAIR checklist.
? Training documents aimed primarily at early career health researchers. This will include an
introduction to the FAIR principles and how these can be implemented without risking privacy
of human research participants.
In line with RDA guidance, the recommendation will also include a maintenance and retirement plan.
? The form and description of milestones and intermediate documents, code or other
deliverables that will be developed during the course of the WGÕs work,

Milestones and intermediate documents:
The main method for formulating and disseminating the guidelines will be through written documents.
Draft documents and other deliverables will be shared for review with the members of the WG through
online channels such as email while the RDA website will provide an open forum for community
review before finalisation.
The tasks for the WG include:
1. Review of the current landscape for FAIR adoption of health research data taking into
consideration levels of privacy and ethical considerations granted to such data in regions
around the world. This will be based on existing and recently completed work done by F4H in
the EU context and the EOSC Landscaping Work currently being carried out. [M1-3]
2. Assessing the impact of such restrictions in terms of research, as well as financial and
societal impacts, drawing on previously mentioned work by F4H, EOSC and others.[M2-6]
3. Analysis of national and international guidelines and policies, and their enforcement to
compare and contrast and provide a foundation for the WGÕs own recommendations. [M3-9]
4. Implementation of draft guidelines at the 4-5 HRPOs to test feasibility. [M9-12]
5. Community surveys to gauge requirements and assess proposed deliverables of the WG.
[M1-12]
6. Deliver final output as a written set of principles to be adopted by the HRPO community, with
care to be taken that these should not be seen as rules that need to be strictly followed
depending on the particular regional and local contexts. [M12]

? A description of the WGÕs mode and frequency of operation (e.g. on-line and/or on-site, how
frequently will the group meet, etc.),
WGÕs mode and frequency of operation:
The guidelines will be reviewed, and different versions will be generated, at the same time that the
objectives and milestones of this WG are achieved.
1. Plenary 15 - Melbourne: Presentation of the objectives of the WG and establishing the initial
approach to the principles and steps to be included in a global HRPO policy for FAIR data.
2. Plenary 16 - Costa Rica: Review in depth of the principles and steps to guide HRPOs to
create a policy (internationally valid) for FAIR data.
3. Plenary 17 - Edinburgh: Approval of the guidelines and preparation of their proposal to
HRPOs.
4. Monthly teleconferences (Skype/MS Teams/GTM/Zoom), F2F meetings at RDA P16 and P17
and other relevant conferences and workshops, mailing lists, open discussion through Twitter
polls, or other simple mechanisms, will be used to develop and review the guidelines and
written intermediate documents, landscape analyses and survey results. Sharing of materials
will be done through OSF and/or Google Drive.
5. Ad-hoc information sharing with relevant initiatives whenever possible (e.g., EOSC Life
Turning FAIR into Reality WG) to ensure alignment with parallel efforts and to help improve
uptake of outputs.
? A description of how the WG plans to develop consensus, address conflicts, stay on track and
within scope, and move forward during operation, and
To develop consensus, address conflicts, stay on track and within scope, and move forward during
operation:
By its own stated goals, this WG aims to resolve conflicts of interest across different regions around
the world to harmonise existing FAIR data policies. This will require addressing sensitivities in relation
to each region and which can only be overcome by inclusion of all relevant stakeholders. RDA will
provide the forum to increase the visibility of this WG and its members form a truly global community
which is perfect for the underlying issues to be tackled by this WG. Moreover, engagement with those
parties that are also doing similar work outlined above will have a significant impact and will help
resolve conflicts. The foundation for creating a set of guidelines will hinge on finding commonalities
across all regions.
Sub-groups will be formed and tasked with each of the stated objectives and these will report back to
the rest of the WG and the wider community with results to meet each milestone and drive uptake.
? A description of the WGÕs planned approach to broader community engagement and
participation.
Community engagement and participation:
? Health Data IG
? FAIR Data Maturity Model WG
? Working Group for Data Security and Trust (WGDST)
? WDS/RDA Assessment of Data fitness for Use WG
? RDA/CODATA Legal Interoperability IG
? RDA/NISO Privacy Implications of Research Data Sets IG
? Ethics and Social Aspects of Data IG
? PID Kernel Information WG
? Reproducibility IG
? Metadata Standards WG
? Metadata IG
? PID IG
? PID Kernel WG
? Data Foundations Terminology IG
? Research Data Provenance IG
? Go FAIR IG
? RDA FAIRsharing WG
Further to these, there will also be engagement with consortia, organisations and communities
outlined previously.
5. Adoption Plan A specific plan for adoption or implementation of the WG Recommendation and other
outcomes within the organizations and institutions represented by WG members, as well as plans for adoption
more broadly within the community. Such adoption or implementation should start within the 18 month time
frame before the WG is complete.
Adoption of the guidelines that will be generated by this WG will be undertaken by members of the
F4H consortium in the first instance for validation. Since there are known jurisdictional variances in
health research data from within the project and its members, this can be used as a sandbox for the
wider global context. Nevertheless, we aim to test the guidelines beyond the EU context, with North
America and Australia in particular as specific targets due to their already advanced state of data
protection legislation.
Training documents will be generated that will allow interpretation of the guidelines into tangible
results, and which will be tailored for local contexts where necessary. These will be aimed primarily at
early career researchers but will also require buy in from senior management to encourage their use.
To this end, all stakeholders will be engaged where possible to ensure that this can happen.
A checklist and/or rubric will be made that can be used by those generating data and/or responsible
for their curation to easily manage data objects and their workflows to comply with a unified FAIR data
policy."
RDA COVID-19 Epidemiology,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rda-covid-19-epidemiology,yes,"The objectives of this Working Group are twofold:
1. to clearly define detailed guidelines on data sharing under the present COVID-19 circumstances to help stakeholders follow best practices to maximize the efficiency of their work
2. to develop guidelines for policymakers to maximise timely data sharing and appropriate responses in such health emergencies.
The group will address the development of such detailed guidelines on the deposit of different data sources in any common data hub or platform. The guidelines aim at developing a system for data sharing in public health emergencies that supports scientific research and policy making, including an overarching framework, common tools and processes, and principles which can be embedded in research practice. The guidelines to be developed will address general aspects related to the principles the data should adhere to (FAIR and other principles), as well as specificities related to five areas (below).
The COVID-19 WG will create a draft set of deliverables in a 3- week timeline (by April 24), with ongoing efforts to continue to add and review material:
1. A set of Guideline documents, highlighting the primary data sharing resources in five areas, each with different data types and cross-cutting themes (e.g. ethics, legal, etc.). Other areas will be added, if required, as the effort proceeds.

i. Co-chairs plus additional support resources.
4. The various roles within each team will provide the input and quality control needed to ensure the WG outputs are of a high quality. The outputs will receive further vetting once drafted by the broader RDA and stakeholder communities.
5. Each of the Area Teams will have weekly calls via Zoom, and there will be 2-3 Zoom Webinar meetings with the full WG membership to review progress and get feedback. The Co-chairs+ Team will meet weekly on Monday, the Co-chairs+ & Moderators Team weekly on Tuesday, The Co-chairs+ & Editorial Team weekly on Wednesday, and the Area Teams weekly on Thursday. The full WG member webinar meetings will be scheduled at appropriate times. The progress of the groups will be tracked by a WG Project Manager using an appropriate tool.
Adoption Plan
Given the critical nature of the global research effort being marshalled to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, the 300+ members of the WG will be asked to indicate adoption/use of the outputs, and to promote through their networks as much as possible. RDAÕs organizational partners will also be asked to do the same.

1. to clearly define detailed guidelines on data sharing under the present COVID-19 circumstances to help stakeholders follow best practices to maximize the efficiency of their work
2. to develop guidelines for policymakers to maximise timely data sharing and appropriate responses in such health emergencies.
The group will address the development of such detailed guidelines on the deposit of different data sources in any common data hub or platform. The guidelines aim at developing a system for data sharing in public health emergencies that supports scientific research and policy making, including an overarching framework, common tools and processes, and principles which can be embedded in research practice. The guidelines to be developed will address general aspects related to the principles the data should adhere to (FAIR and other principles), as well as specificities related to five areas (below).

InteroperAble Descriptions of Observable Property Terminology WG (I-ADOPT WG),https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/interoperable-descriptions-observable-property-terminology-wg-i-adopt-wg,yes,"The I-ADOPT WG will produce an Interoperability Framework, co-developed by a wide community of terminology experts, for representing observable properties. This effort will have a strong focus on observable properties in environmental research because it leverages existing efforts to accurately encode what was measured, observed, derived, or computed in relation to the earth systems. But many of the principles it will lean on will be relevant to or connected with other domains. The construction of the framework will be informed by a review of current practices used in the community. Furthermore, the working group will iteratively test and refine the framework through a set of in-depth use cases. Much like a generic blueprint, the refined conceptual framework will be a basis upon which terminology developers can formulate or refine their local design patterns, in alignment with others. With these, they may leverage their local resources in a collective attempt to represent complex properties observed across the environmental sciences (from marine, atmospheric, and terrestrial Earth sciences, as well as biodiversity). The WG will then seek to synthesize these approaches and share outcomes with other research communities in
1 Terminology is used as the overarching name for any set of fixed denotations that are used to describe something with the goal to reduce ambiguity and facilitate interoperability. A terminology can range from a simple controlled vocabulary (a simple list of terms) to a complex ontology (formal definitions of terms and their relations semantically expressed in a machine-readable way). This term may also include taxonomies, thesauri, or any other kinds of knowledge organization sources.

order to develop a set of best practice recommendations. Furthermore, it will help mediate between generic observation standards (O&M, OBOE, SOSA/SSNO, SensorML, ..) and current community-led resources, fostering harmonized implementations. Through this effort, FAIRer observable property terminologies will be created, the global effectiveness of tools operating upon them will be improved and their impact increased. The WG will thus strengthen existing collaborations and build new connections between terminology developers and providers, disciplinary experts, and representatives of scientific data user groups.
Core Activities
- Collecting user stories from different stakeholder views, which should be domain-agnostic and rely on real applications of data where an interoperable description of observation and measurement data is needed
- Gathering requirements to enhance the interoperability of terminology used to describe observational data pursued through a series of use cases, which will be developed through the formalisation of the collected user stories into more generic and classified descriptions
- Surveying existing, semantic representations and design patterns of observable properties including descriptions of methodologies, instrumentation, and environmental context used in different environmental domains, focusing on a few widely used variables
- Analysing the overlaps and gaps between these representations on the basis of the requirements of each use case (leveraging the list composed by the W3C review of Sensor and Observations Ontology6 but also extending to those represented by members of the group, such as SVO, Complex Properties Model, variable treatment in schema.org, including those which we will additionally discover during the survey)
- Building on the above, the development and iterative refinement of a conceptual framework to support interoperability between representations of observable properties across participating terminologies.
- Deploy the interoperability framework in selected linguistic settings and derive recommendations for translations
- Developing local, aligned design patterns across participating terminologies
Value Proposition
Addressing the ÒIÓ of FAIR Data Management
The activity proposed by this group will address the I (interoperability) of the FAIR data principles. The Interoperability Framework, a conceptual framework for describing observable properties, will foster the interoperability among cross domain terminologies by providing recommendations to support the systematic expression of the observable properties, thus paving the way for seamless terminology alignment.

User benefits
Research communities (e.g., domain scientists, ontology engineers, data providers, data centers, etc.) may gain the following benefits through the deliverables produced by the WG (i.e., a review of existing observation-centric semantic representations and recommendations for terminology harmonization):
? a basis to align semantic products,
? guidance in identifying and adapting relevant observation representations and/or further developing their own standards for data publication and ingestion,
? recommendations for a minimum viable set of elements and relationships to encode complex semantic descriptions of observable properties (footnote: when adopted, these elements will allow data aggregators, such as the Australian National Data Service, to integrate data and metadata from diverse sources, provide a common interface for data discovery, and thus enable data reuse),
? a means for identifying relevant terminologies for the annotation of datasets through the systematic comparison of observation-centric models, and
? access to terminologies that can be leveraged to support semantic searches and improve data curation and dissemination activities on data portals. (footnote: for example, the recommendations may help data curators to decide on the ÔmandatoryÕ metadata elements of datasets (concerning observable properties) that should be submitted by data authors).
Engagement with existing work in the area
I-ADOPT WG, which is a task group within the RDA Interest Group on Vocabulary and Semantic Services (VSSIG), engages a number of parties, including Research Infrastructures (RI), data centers, terminology providers, which are already addressing the challenge of representing observable properties (see list of external supporting projects in the appendix) and relevant RDA groups. The WG will ensure that these parties are connecting their domain-specific activities and keep their efforts more synchronised by identifying and adopting measures that enable them to grow more efficiently, sustainably, and collaboratively. Such experts will be directly involved in providing their own use cases and co-developing the interoperability framework. It is primarily the task of the current WG members to actively reach out to their communities and to represent I-ADOPT WG and its work, e.g. in presentations or direct communication. If not engaged directly, the WG will maintain bilateral discussions with these parties.
Directly involved parties:
The eLTER RI (Integrated European Long-Term Ecosystem, Critical Zone & Socio-Ecological Research Infrastructure)7 comprises a wide range of highly instrumented sites focusing on terrestrial, freshwater and transitional water ecosystems on a European scale. eLTER RI is building on the site network of LTER Europe and is currently in the phase of its operational

implementation. It enables the in-situ and co-located acquisition and gathering of ecosystem characteristics and Essential Variables ranging from biochemistry to biodiversity as well as socio-ecological characteristics of LTSER regions. In addition to providing well documented and maintained datasets, the provision of a semantically well-defined set of terms is the basis for later analysis. It serves as harmonized specification of parameters in the observation and measurement of ecosystem processes. Therefore, the EnvThes (Environmental Thesaurus)8 a controlled vocabulary, was developed for the LTER-Europe community using the Complex Properties Model [2]. It serves as a unified semantic backbone for the provision of data in the eLTER context. EnvThes is based on the core ontology of SERONTO9, developed for the AlterNet FP6 project, as well as building on the core concepts of US LTER CV10.
The International Long Term Ecological Research (ILTER)11 Network, comprised of 44 member networks, inter-alia seeks improved interoperability and consistency of the data archived in its multiple repositories. Toward this goal, members of the ILTER information management community are participating in the development of a multilingual ecological thesaurus to harmonize terms applied to whole datasets. Another challenge facing the ILTER Network in the global context is to annotate ILTER datasets with observable properties to enhance interoperability and discoverability. Currently, only a small set of ILTER datasets show such annotations, and no best practices have been established for this process outside DEIMS-SDR. ILTER semantics specialists will participate in this WG to help articulate best practices for an interoperability framework for observable properties.
As a multidisciplinary ICSU World Data Center, PANGAEA12 comprises more than 140.000 measurement and observation types. To improve the consistency, interoperability, and findability of archived data, PANGAEA links measurement and observation types to existing terminologies like WoRMS, ICES, ChEBI, QUDT, ENVO etc. [3]. For this purpose PANGAEA has developed a terminology catalog as part of its editorial system. More recently, in the context of the GFBio13 project, a terminology service has been implemented14, significantly reducing the effort necessary to maintain the bilateral interfaces with the various terminologies.
The British Oceanographic Data Centre - UK Research and Innovation (BODC) hosts the NERC Vocabulary Server (NVS)15 which has successfully served controlled vocabularies to the marine domain for more than 10 years. NVS provides access to lists of standardized terms and thesauri that cover a broad spectrum of disciplines relevant to the oceanographic and wider community. It is published as Linked Data using the World Wide Web Consortium's Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) to represent knowledge in a format understandable by computers. All of the vocabularies are fully versioned and assured (governed) by a dedicated group of experts before publication. The largest of these vocabularies is the ÔBODC Parameter Usage VocabularyÕ

(P01)16 which is used to annotate the fields of data files with the physical properties that the numbers represent. P01 is used to identify what the data value represents, describing precisely what was measured, derived, predicted or estimated. P01 concepts are built from a rigorous, exposed, semantic model that is fed by either internal or external controlled vocabularies. The use of the NVS has been widely adopted in the context of European (SeaDataNet I/SeaDataNet II/SeaDataCloud2, EUROFLEETSv2, and EMODnet projects) and international initiatives (e.g. EU H2020 AtlantOS, Ocean Data Interoperability Project (ODIP), etc.)
The Scientific Variables Ontology (SVO)17 is a framework that enables modular, principled expression, manipulation, and creation of scientific variable concepts [4]. It provides a formal, domain-agnostic upper ontology, a set of machine-readable rules that define how elementary concepts can be combined to create more complex concepts, an extensible lower ontology that declares all of the instances of the concept category classes defined in the upper ontology, a simple search interface that allows casual users to browse the current database using exact term match of both preferred and alternate (synonym) labels stored in the ontology, a SPARQL endpoint, an API for matching freeform strings to concepts in the ontology using information from public linked data catalogs, a concept-based graph search, and the ontology blueprint, and a GUI tool for constructing new variables. SVO was motivated by the need to map a selection of over 13,000 CF Standard Names and NWIS SRS names into the CSDMS standard names (CSN) object-process-quantity (O-P-Q) format for use within the CSDMS earth systems modelling framework. During this effort, the O-P-Q data model was significantly augmented and revised, and ontological design patterns were developed that would allow more flexible, modular, and descriptive encoding of scientific variable concepts. SVO is currently used for semantic mediation within the interdisciplinary, collaborative MINT18 framework, a system that integrates data and models through automated workflows to assist analysts in predictive modelling of complex systems.
LifeWatch ERIC19 (LW ERIC) is a European Infrastructure Consortium providing e-Science facilities to scientists seeking to increase our knowledge and deepen our understanding on Biodiversity organization and Ecosystem functions and services in order to address key planetary challenges. LW ERIC provides data tools and services for a large and broad user community dealing with a variety of data types (taxonomic, functional traits, genetic, ecological, biogeographic, environmental and various types of observation data). Essential services supplied by LW ERIC are data curation, long-term data storage and preservation, data analysis and data publication. Data curation includes quality control of data, semantic annotation, data cataloging and the development of terminologies according to international protocols and standards. LW ERIC developed and is extending domain-specific thesauri with a particular focus on functional biodiversity and an ontology (LifeWatch Core Ontology) as a semantic framework for data harmonization and integration.

resources in the ecological domain supporting the community in the management and alignment of their semantics.
AnaEE21 is the RI dedicated to experimentation on continental ecosystems and their biodiversity. It provides facilities to experiment in controlled, semi-controlled or open-air environments as well as analytical platforms and tools for data management and modeling. Due to the large heterogeneity of the data produced, the harmonized management and sharing of data is one of the main AnaEE challenges. Based on semantic interoperability of its components and the use of common vocabularies (AnaeeThes thesaurus and an OBOE-based ontology), a distributed Information System (IS) is under development. Discovery (ISO19115/19139 standard) and access portals are fed by triples produced by the semantic annotation of the AnaEE distributed resources (relational databases and modeling platforms). Two pipelines developed within the ENVRIplus context automate the semantic annotation of the distributed IS and the generation of metadata records and data sets. The AnaEE IS team aims at contributing to the fully strategic RDA WG and will take benefit from the expected results for the implementation of data semantic interoperability within and among RIs.
The DLR-Institute of Data Science is currently active in standardization efforts for observational data models in the context of citizen science. This includes activities dedicated to enabling interoperability between observed parameters in the context of Citizen Science, e.g. in the OGC Interoperability Experiment22 and a community of practice for citizen observatories recently established within the EU project WeObserve23 as well as in data standardization activities, e.g. within the Citizen Science COST Action CA1521224or the OGC (description of Earth Observation Products).
AquaDiva25 is a large CRC aiming to study the effect of biodiversity on the subsurface levels in the German Hainich forest. To this end, a number of scientists from different domains, including ecology, biology, and geosciences, are collecting samples covering different aspects and thus generating a large number of heterogeneous data sets. Furthermore, scientists may use unstructured data, such as text to store datasets related information. In order to answer the research questions, datasets generated by different groups of scientists should be integrated and then analyzed. In order to deal with the heterogeneity issue, the AquaDiva CRC is building a semantic layer on top of datasets stored in a common repository. These datasets cover a wide range of aspects and a large number of ontologies is required to cover those aspects. An essential step to building such a conceptual layer is to allow interoperability across this set of ontologies.

SIOS26 is a regional observing system for long-term measurements in and around Svalbard addressing Earth System Science questions. SIOS integrates the existing distributed observational infrastructure, exchanging discovery metadata via the OAI-PMH protocol serving either GCMD DIF or ISO19115. Harmonization of data across the contributing data centers is ongoing pushing for standardization and is more mature in the physical domain (meteorology and oceanography) than in the biological domain. Controlled vocabularies which are in use include GCMD DIF, OSGeo Cat-Interop, Climate, and Forecast Convention. But development is ongoing for internal vocabularies using SKOS, including collections, institutions, and platforms. SIOS is also working on WIGOS metadata standards for building a station catalog.
Representatives of the OBO Foundry and Library27, a federation of hundreds of production and research ontologies, will contribute refined best practices in highly-expressive semantic research and engineering [5]. The widely-adopted Environment Ontology (ENVO)28, with its focus on Earth and environmental phenomena, will be the hub of this activity. Its standing interoperation with other OBO ontologies used to represent observations, collection activities, and the representation of information artifacts, as well as its links to United Nations semantic interoperability efforts and data systems, will contribute to the WGs pool of expertise and stakeholders. ENVO [6] will also serve as a link to the UNESCO Global Ocean Observing SystemÕs (GOOS) Essential Ocean Variables, the Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) FederationÕs Semantic Web for Earth and Environment Technology (SWEET) Ontology29, and the UN EnvironmentÕs Sustainable Development Goals Interface Ontology. These, and other linked efforts, all seek property-level interoperability which may be catalyzed through this WG.
CF conventions30 for climate and forecast metadata were designed to promote the processing and sharing of files created with the netCDF Application Programmer Interface [NetCDF]. The conventions define metadata that provide a definitive description of what the data in each variable represents, and of the spatial and temporal properties of the data. This enables users of data from different sources to decide which quantities are comparable, and facilitates building applications with powerful extraction, regridding, and display capabilities. The CF conventions generalize and extend the COARDS conventions. The extensions include metadata that provides a precise definition of each variable via specification of a standard name, describes the vertical locations corresponding to dimensionless vertical coordinate values, and provides the spatial coordinates of non-rectilinear gridded data.
The International Bio-logging SocietyÕs Working Group on Data Standardization31 is tasked with addressing the Society's goal Òto progress standardization of data protocols used within the bio-logging community, with a view to making databases interoperable.Ó This WG has identified that vocabularies (i.e. the terms used to describe on-animal sensor data that originate from both

sensorsÑe.g. location coordinatesÑand biologistsÑe.g. species names, and their definitions and relationships) as a critical issue we must address to enable data standardization and interoperability. This is a challenge due to numerous sets of terms in wide use by existing bio-logging databases and equipment manufacturers. Another challenge is the interdisciplinary nature of bio-logging, which can encompass marine and terrestrial ecology, earth sciences, biodiversity and all regions of the earth, making most discipline- or region-specific standards unavailable for use by the field as a whole.
The USA NSFÕs Arctic Data Center (ADC)32 is responsible for archiving all data products produced by Arctic researchers funded under NSFÕs Polar Programs.
The USA NSFÕs DataONE33 cyberinfrastructure is a major metadata/data aggregator, offering services that include replication, and federated search across over 3 dozen major earth and environmental science data repositories. DataONE is developing together with ADC a semantic search and annotation framework to improve discoverability and reusability of its data holdings, based on existing best-of-class ontologies such as EnvO, and using a semantic design pattern for observational data, OBOƒ, that is harmonized with the OGC/ISO O&M and OBO FoundryÕs EQ.
The Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) hosts the Research Vocabularies Australia (RVA), a terminology server that enables users to publish, manage and discover vocabulary from various domains. CSIRO played a major role (through Simon Cox) in developing international standards such as Geography Markup Language and Observations & Measurements. The organization also developed SISSVoc, a RESTful API that provides persistence access to SKOS-based vocabularies.
University of Amsterdam (UvA) leads the development of the ontology of Open Information Linking for environmental science Research Infrastructure (OIL-e34) based on the ENVRI Reference Model35, and the community knowledge base for ENVRI research infrastructures in the context of ENVRI, ENVRIPLUS, and ENVRI-FAIR36 projects. UvA has been active in modeling network and virtual infrastructures using semantic web technologies, and in applying those semantic models in Virtual Research Environment to enable applications to across different infrastructures [7].

Interaction with existing RDA groups
I-ADOPT will interact with the following groups, identified during the BoF session at the 13th PM, concerning specific items in its work plan and scope:
? Data Fabric IG: I-ADOPT will evaluate the framework of software components the Data Fabric group is concerned with, and contribute feedback regarding those components that may be essential to deliver property management across disciplines and legal/technical boundaries. I-ADOPT will also contribute to Data Fabric discussions on the cross-disciplinary and global governance of e-infrastructures and their components with respect to observable property management.
? Data Type Registries WG: The properties under discussion within I-ADOPT can act as a customer case for the DTR groupÕs foreseen system or federation of registries. The I-ADOPT group may contribute key requirements from its use cases to the DTR WG discussions, and, in particular, feedback on registry governance schemas under discussion in DTR.
? Data Foundations and Terminology IG: I-ADOPT WG will consider the DFT IG's maintained vocabularies as further input for the analysis of existing observation representation strategies (Task 4), and then evaluate against the use cases and requirements.
? Biodiversity Data Integration IG: This group deals with morphological, genomic, biochemical and anatomical traits, environmental measurements and taxonomic and nomenclatural information of species within the DiSSCo38 research infrastructure. Like I-ADOPT it seeks to identify existing key resources that can be part of a trans-disciplinary commons it is clear that there is a considerable overlap which has to be aligned between the two groups.
? Small Unmanned Aircraft SystemsÕ Data IG: Introducing a new technology, this groupÕs main objective is to develop and adopt standards and best practices as early as possible. I-ADOPTÕs input will be valuable to steer this group towards interoperability. ? Marine Data Harmonization IG: This group is focusing on marine data harmonization developing a common global framework for the management of marine data and I-ADOPT will make sure our efforts are aligned. ? IG Physical Samples and Collections in the Research Data Ecosystem: This group focuses on persistence identification, representation and discovery of physical samples and sample collections. The review and recommendations that will be produced by I-ADOPT are relevant to the group, as one of the activities of interest the group is to identify common concepts describing samples and related resources. ? Education and Training on handling of research data IG: To increase the interoperability and adaptability of training materials the group wants to collaborate with I-ADOPT to achieve a broader standardization of terms.

? Research Data Repository Interoperability WG: The WG is interested in the outcome of I-ADOPT because harmonizing parameter descriptions in data packages could increase re-usability, raise acceptance and consolidate data package exchange within domains.
? Using Schema.org and enriching metadata to enable/boost FAIRness on research resource: As this group is looking into discoverability of research data via schema.org, I-ADOPTÕs Interoperability Framework may be an important contribution to the groupÕs requirements. Additionally, their outcomes will help align our framework to schema.org extensions.
Workplan
The WGÕs work plan constitutes a progressively more refined process of alignment between the representation of observable properties across participating environmental terminologies. During this process, new perspectives, synthesis, and recommendations will be formulated and delivered to the wider community. At the close of the WG, a new level of interoperability between distinct, but aligned, resources will be realized, and form the basis for more bold initiatives in the future.
Tasks:
Task 1: Collecting user stories
Collect user stories of observational research from environmental parties involved as input to Task 3. These should refer to applications of data where an interoperable description of observation and measurement data is needed. Formalize user stories into a set of use cases (NovemberÐDecember 2019) - leverage P14 for community input.
Task 2: Survey observation-centric terminologies
Conduct a survey, and synthesize the results of related surveys conducted by other groups (like the Polar Vocabulary survey39), of observation-centric top-level representations (in most cases ontologies) and domain-specific terminologies (mostly taxonomies, thesauri, controlled lists for

units, methods, instruments, etc.) in use. If necessary, prepare a questionnaire to be sent out Q1 2020, (6 weeks of circulation).
This will contribute to building a fine-grained collection list of semantic representations of observable properties (as input for task 4) and to a catalog of domain specific terminologies.
Task 3: Deriving use case requirements
Derive requirements from the use cases that have been formalized in Task 1 as input to Tasks 4 and 5 (FebruaryÐApril 2020) - finalize with a discussion at P15
Task 4: Analysis of existing representation strategies
The application of existing representation strategies to the observable properties in each use case will be analyzed in order to identify gaps, overlaps, strengths and weaknesses. The survey and a brief literature review40 will be used as source material. The findings will be used to instantiate the use cases and define/refine the conceptual framework. (MayÐOctober 2020)
Task 5: Developing the Interoperability Framework
Define the Interoperability Framework for observable properties based on the outcomes of Tasks 3 and 4 (see Value proposition). As a subtask, potential issues in deploying the framework in selected linguistic settings (e.g., Chinese) will be tested to derive recommendations for translations (November 2010ÐJanuary 2021).
Task 6: Development of Design Patterns
In line with the Interoperability Framework, WG participants will develop local, aligned design patterns across several participating terminology resources for selected use cases (FebruaryÐApril 2021)
Milestones:
M1 User stories and terminologies collected (2020-01-31)
M2 Collection of requirements completed (2020-03-31)
M3 Overlap and gap analysis completed (2020-10-31)
M4 Consensus achieved on the Interoperability Framework (2021-01-31)
Deliverables:

WGs mode:
? meet twice a month (one US-friendly and one Australian-friendly telco) to coordinate actions, one extra telco for WG chairs and technical group
? organize remote hackathons to work on common tasks and accelerate progress
? at least 4 physical meetings at the RDA Plenary Meetings (14th, 15th, 16th, 17th) with one (or more) co-located VoCamps at the Plenary Meetings
? use of GitHub for issues tracking and solving
Consensus and conflict management:
I-ADOPT WG plans to develop consensus by encouraging and ensuring participation in meetings, both virtual and physical. Collaborative work will be done ahead of conference calls and active discussion will be encouraged during calls in order to draw from a wide range of ideas. This should ensure that team members are heard and acknowledged and that the development is not biased toward the thinking of a few members. For critical issues the WG will vote using a weighted multi-vote approach whereby each member can cast up to three votes, from most to least preferred. This approach ensures members think thoroughly about the available options and decreases chances of stalemate. The co-chairs are committed to keeping the development on track and within scope. The WG will adopt a framework for ranking priorities that helps the team deciding which option will "
Data Citation WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/data-citation-wg.html,yes,"The case statement outlines our work and provides the focus and the boundaries where our research will go. We need to integrate all stakeholders and reflect their views accordingly. So far we identified four stakeholders that will actually use our contributions:
? Data providers Ð data will be reused
? Solution providers Ð machine readable data citations
? Researchers Ð receives citable results
? Community Ð gains trust and transparency
The beneficiaries will be able to reuse data, reproduce experiments, provide machine readable and machine actionable data citations for complex data sets and trace their data and its usage.
Being able to reliably and efficiently cite entire or subsets of data in large and dynamically growing or changing datasets constitutes a significant challenge for a range of research domains. Several approaches for assigning PIDs to support data citation at different levels in the process have been proposed. These may range from individual PIDs being assigned to individual data elements to PIDs assigned to queries executed on time-stamped and versioned databases.
Based on the discussions at the First Plenary Meeting in Gothenburg, the formation of a Working Group on Data Citation (WG-DC) was initiated. The RDA Working Group on Data Citation (WG-DC) aims to bring together a
CASE STATEMENT PROPOSAL v.1/ RDA WORKING GROUP ON DATA CITATION 5/8/2013 6:38:46 PM
page 2
group of experts to discuss the issues, requirements, advantages and shortcomings of existing approaches for efficiently citing subsets of data. The WG-DC focuses on a narrow field where we can contribute significantly and provide prototypes and reference implementations. So far different data citation initiatives exist, all of which have their advantages and special purposes. An overview of these standards and their best practices was published by the CODATA Task Group on Digital Data Curation [1]. We encourage strong cooperation with existing initiatives is required: CODATA, OpenAire, DataCite, W3C, Open Annotation Coalition and the related standards.
Our concept includes machine actionable data citation that is efficient and can be applied transparently. We will be looking at different types of data and database management systems, including:
- SQL-style databases
- XML databases / semi-structured databases
- Graph-based databases
- NetCDF files
- HDF5 files
- É
The goal is to assure that subsections of data can be uniquely identified in the face of data being added, deleted or otherwise modified in a database, across longer periods of time, even when data is being migrated from one DBMS to another. We want to discuss and evaluate different existing approaches to this challenge, evaluate their advantages and shortcomings and identify obstacles to their deployment in different settings, as well as concrete recommendations for the deployment of prototypes within existing data centers. Amongst others these should subsequently form a solid basis for citing data, linking to it from publications in an actionable manner.
Dynamic data citation tackles challenges of versioning and the proper definition of subsets of data in different domains. Potential issues concern the relations between data sets, which need to be captured as well. Other challenges are scalability, costs and benefits (trade off) of ownership and operations that are potentially not reversible. This WG concentrates on the technical aspects of data citation solutions, focusing on proof of concept and prototype implementations. It will collaborate with other RGA working groups on PIDs and other topics under the umbrella of the Interest Group on Data Publication.
The principle currently proposed includes the following aspects:
- Ensuring that data items added to a data collection are added in a manner that is time-stamped
- Ensuring that the data collection is versioned, i.e. changes/deletions to the data are marked as changed with validity timestamps
- PIDs are assigned to the query/expression identifying a certain subset of the data that one wishes to cite, with the query being time-stamped as well
- Hash keys are computed for the selection result to allow subsequent verification of identity
- Issues such as unique sorting of results need to be considered when the operation returns data as sets and subsequent process work on the sequence the data is provided in
These should be working across all settings where we have a combination of data sources and operations identifying subsets at specific points in time.
We propose a three stage plan consisting of solutions (short-term), plans (mid-term) and the future perspective (long-term).
2.1 Short-term goals (M12)
? Evaluation of recommended data citation approaches for specific scenarios
? Selecting pilot candidates in cooperation with stakeholders/data owners
? Detailed planning of technical aspects of data citation approach preparing for implementation
CASE STATEMENT PROPOSAL v.1/ RDA WORKING GROUP ON DATA CITATION 5/8/2013 6:38:46 PM
page 3
? Develop a model for long term proof data citation within databases and initial prototypes and demonstrators.
2.2 Mid-term goals (M18)
? Develop a set of reference implementations of the data citation model for selected pilot data types.
? Evaluate developed prototypes
? Establish consensus on a universal data citation model that can be implemented independently from specific systems or vendors.
?
2.3 Long-term goals (> M18)
? Seek official endorsement for data citation within the RDA community and foster the application of identified standards.
? Become the contact point for data citation questions and provide the community with best practices and know how.
2.4 Timeframe
The following figure depicts the sequence of the three phases. All of them will be accompanied by networking and intense feedback loops between the WG-DC, the data providers, the solution providers and the community. Fruitful collaboration with other initiatives such as CODATA, DataCite, W3C, open Annotation coalition and others is carried out along all three phases.

3. Value Proposition
Digitally driven research is a rather young discipline that evolves fast. As a result the tools and the data are rarely developed with a focus of long term awareness. What matters most to researchers are fast results and prompt publications. Whether the data they produce today can be understood, interpreted or even accessed in the future is hardly an issue these days. Only if results can be reproduced precisely, the validity of research experiments and business processes can be judged, evaluated and verified in a machine-actionable manner that is scalable and can cope with dynamically changing data,. Hence there is a strong need for data citation mechanisms that allow identifying portions of large data set with a precision.
An additional challenge within the area of research data is the requirement to cite evolving data reliably. Researchers need the possibility to reference data material that is subject to change. Hence mechanisms are required that allow to cite data as the used it during a particular experiment. When the data gets updated, modified or deleted, these changes must be reflected by the citation system as well. Therefore time based data is an important factor. Also the possibility to specify subsets and derived data is a requirement. Being able to identify, reference, share and distribute specific subsets encourages reuse amongst researchers. The easier and more transparently this citation process can be implemented, the higher is the acceptance among the target audience and the designated community. We will provide proofs of concept, mockups and prototype implementations that can be tested and used by the community. We want to go beyond theoretical work and deliver real world applications for our models. In an optimal setting, a researcher, when selecting a subset of data for an experiment, will be issued with a PID that allows others retrieving the same data set again.
The international orientation and interdisciplinary nature of the RDA community provides input from various interesting areas, enabling broad research and application of the results of the WG-DC. Participation of researchers, data providers, solution providers and the community allow integrating expert knowledge from various perspectives. This direct access to domain experts boosts the development of new standards within the area of data citation and allows improvement via direct feedback loops. Collaboration with other initiatives in the field is also a key concern of this WG.
3.1 Individuals, communities, and initiatives that will benefit from the RDA WG on Data Citation.
? Researchers: by being able to cite their data
? Database developers: by reducing redundancy
? Digital preservation managers: by being able to retrieve subsets of data
? Data centers: by enhancing reuse of existing resources
? Data managers and data scientists: having tools for referencing subsets in dynamic data environments
? Professional societies: by reproducing experiments
? Publishers: by encouraging reuse and an increased level of trust
? Repositories, data archives: by being able to reference, cite and retrieve subsets
? Software tool developers: by allowing transparent implementation of data citation capabilities
3.2 Key impacts of the RDA Data Citation initiative
? Provide the knowhow for data citation of partial datasets from dynamic data sources
? Enhance reproducibility of research results by allowing peers to re-execute experiments
? Facilitate discovery, access, and reference of large data sets
? Provide a reference model for dynamic data citation
? Enhance digital preservation of data sets and their reference

5. Work Plan
5.1 Work plan components
1. Analysis of requirements and the selection of candidate solutions (months 1-6)
In the beginning phase we will consult existing work in the area of data citation and study available best practices [1]. We will evaluate recommended data citation approaches for specific scenarios and select pilot candidates. The selection of these candidates will be in close cooperation with stakeholders and data owners. Detailed planning of the technical aspects of data citation approaches will guide us during the implementation.
2. Defining the reference model (months 4-12)
We will develop a technical reference model for data citation in relational database systems. This model should be open, extensible and implementation agnostic. It defines how research data must be structured in order to allow the citation of subsets.
3. Improve and test the model iteratively (months 8-15)
The model developed in the previous step will be evaluated against suitable data sets of considerable site from various research disciplines. The consortium partners will be asked to provide their real world research sets as a testbed upon which the model can be evaluated. This will follow an iterative approach on order to allow improvements.
After the model has been carefully tested, a reference architecture for citable research data will be implemented. This reference implementation should be based on open source software in order to be usable and improvable by all participating partners. Hence this phase provides a second feedback loop for the iterative improvement and testing phase. The implementation has to be generic and flexible enough for being adapted to various purposes. An official release will follow the implementation and iterative improvement phase.
4. Promotion of the RDA Data Citation Model and Reference Implementation (months 12-18)
Promotion activities will include wide-spread dissemination about the data citation model. The ready to use reference implementation will be accompanied by substantial documentation and use case scenarios in order to increase acceptance and encourage contributions.

RDA/WDS Scholarly Link Exchange (Scholix) WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rdawds-scholarly-link-exchange-scholix-wg,yes,"The Scholarly Link Exchange Working group aims to enable a comprehensive global view of the links between scholarly literature and data.  The working group will leverage existing work and international initiatives to work towards a global information commons by establishing:
?	Pathfinder services and enabling infrastructure
?	An interoperability framework with guidelines and standards (see also www.scholix.org) 
?	A significant consensus
?	Support for communities of practice and implementation

By the end of this 18 month WG period there will be:
?	A critical mass of Scholix conformant hubs providing the enabling infrastructure for a global view of data-literature links
?	Pathfinder services providing aggregations, query services, and analyses
?	Beneficiaries of these services accessing data-literature link information to add value to scholarly journal sites, data centre portals, research impact services, research discovery services, research management software, etc.
?	Operational workflows to populate the infrastructure with data-literature links 
?	Better understanding of current data-literature interlinking landscape viewed from the perspective of e.g. disciplines, publishers, repositories etc. 

The working group follows on from the RDA/WDS Publishing Data Services WG, https://rd-alliance.org/groups/rdawds-publishing-data-services-wg.html.  The original working group established demonstrator services enabling infrastructure.  The follow on working group will support the ÒhardeningÓ of that infrastructure and services as well as an increase in the number of participating hubs and services. The original working group established an interoperability framework. The follow on group will provide further specification, documentation and profiling of that framework to support adoption by link contributors and consumers.  The original working group established a consensus among large infrastructure providers and early adopters; the follow up group will extend that consensus to the next stage of adopters and to a more diverse set of infrastructure providers.  The original working group harnessed the energy and interest of specialists; the follow up group will provide support for a number of communities and services as they implement and adopt the framework and vision established in the original group.
The working group believes a global system for linking data and literature should be: 
?	Cross-disciplinary and global (built for, and aspiring to, comprehensiveness)
?	Transparent with provenance allowing users to make trust and quality decisions
?	Open and non-discriminatory in terms of content coverage and user access (this also means ranging from formal to informal, and from structured to non-structured content)
?	Standards-based (content standards and exchange protocols)
?	Participatory and adopted, including community buy-in
?	Sustainable
?	An enabling infrastructure, on top of which services can be built (as opposed to a monolithic Òone-stop-shopÓ solution).

Value Proposition
The WG aims to oversee and guide the maturation of a distributed global system to collect, normalize, aggregate, store, and share links between research data and the literature. This will build upon the output of the preceding Data Publishing Services Working Group, which delivered a consensus vision and set of guidelines called the Scholix Framework, together with an operational system called the Data-Literature Interlinking (DLI) System, which puts these guidelines into practice as a pathfinder implementation. The WG proposed here will build out these assets into an operational infrastructure and service layer that is to become the de facto go-to place for organizations to deposit or retrieve links between research data and the literature.

The value of such a system ultimately rests on the value of links between research data and the literature. The utility of such links is threefold (see also the Case Statement of the Data Publishing Services WG):
1.	They improve the visibility and discoverability of research data (and relevant literature), so that researchers can find relevant material more easily.
2.	They help place research data in the right context, so that researchers can re-use data more effectively.
3.	They support credit attribution mechanisms, which incentivize researchers to share their data in the first place.

These value elements are illustrated below, and in more detail in Annex A. 
 
While there is broad support for the value and utility of data-literature links amongst the various stakeholders in research data publishing (including researchers as the ultimate end-users of this information), organizing the associated information space is not an easy feat: there are many disconnected sources with overlapping information, and there is a wide heterogeneity in practices today - both at a technical level (different PID systems, storage systems, etc.) and at a social level (different ways of referencing a data set in the literature, different moments in time to assert a link, etc.). As a consequence, the landscape today is incomplete and patchy, characterized by independent, many-to-many non-standard solutions - for example a bilateral arrangement between a journal publisher and a data center. This is both inefficient and limiting in the value that can be delivered to researchers.

The universal linking infrastructure which this WG strives to put in place represents a systemic change. It will offer an overarching, cohesive structure that binds together many of todayÕs practices into a common interoperability framework - which will ensure that links between research data and the literature can be easily shared, aggregated, and used on a global scale. This will drive a network effect, where the value in the system as a whole is greater than the sum of individual parts: for researchers as end-users, this value lies in the comprehensiveness and quality of link information; for service providers and infrastructure providers (including journal publishers and data centers), the value also lies in simplicity, efficiency, and reduction of friction in the process by being able to work with a single interface to deposit and retrieve links (and, potentially, the possibility to benefit from additional services developed on top of the core infrastructure).

Who will benefit and Impact

Mapping the value proposition as described in the above to the various stakeholders and actors in research data publishing (copied largely from the Data Publishing Services WG Summary & Recommendations), benefits and impact may be summarized as follows:
?	For data repositories and journal publishers: linking data and the literature will increase their visibility and usage, and can support additional services to improve the user experience on online platforms (for example, offering links to relevant data sets with articles, or offering links to the literature that will help place data in context). In contrast to the bilateral arrangements that we often see today between data centers and journal publishers, the global linking infrastructure will make the process of linking data sets and research literature a more robust, comprehensive, and scalable enterprise.
?	For research institutes, bibliographic service providers, and funding bodies: the infrastructure will enable advanced bibliographic services and productivity assessment tools that track datasets and journal publications within a common and comprehensive framework.
?	For researchers: firstly, the infrastructure will make the processes of finding and accessing  relevant articles and data sets easier and more effective. Secondly  it will make it possible for researchers to track long-term impact of their data (and publications), thereby providing additional incentives to share data.

Adoption Plan:
The Adoption Plan for this Working Group is quite mature since it builds on a previous working group, includes adopter work packages, includes outreach and documentation work packages, targets new hubs, and focuses on benefit realisation.

Previous Working Group:  The proposed working group builds directly on the Data Publishing Services Working Group which has a considerable membership with an active core of contributors. The WG is representative of publishers, data centres, research organisations and research information infrastructure services who are the key stakeholder and adopter communities. The existing momentum and buy-in of this group will be leveraged for adoption.

Technical Development of Hubs: In a similar vein, the WG activity plan includes targeted activity to extend existing hubs (CrossRef, DataCite, OpenAire, RMap) and establish new hubs in new community areas (such as Astronomy, Life Sciences).

Implementation Sub Projects: The working group case statement ÒActivitiesÓ section provides details of a number of adoption sub projects.  The Scholix framework that underpins the WG approach involves content publishers (eg journal publishers or data centres) communicating with natural hubs (eg CrossRef and DataCite). This WG activity plan includes implementation projects from publisher to hub.

Documentation and Support Materials: The WG activity plan includes an extension of the Scholix framework by providing documentation of instantiation of the abstract Scholix information model in various technologies or formats (such as xml, rdf, json) and using a number of common protocols (such as open api calls, sparql, oai-pmh, resourceSync). These specification and implementation materials will also be the product of the development and adoption projects described above.

Outreach, Liaison, Collaboration:  This Working Group focuses on a technical solution to the exchange and aggregation of data-literature link information.  Other peak bodies and advocacy groups focus on changing practice and integrating data citation as part of scientific practice.  The WG work plan includes collaboration with those organisations to leverage their established agendas.  Current members of the WG include leaders in these organisations and further such activity is slated in that area of the work plan.

Benefit realisation: The sustainable driver of adoption is benefit for the adopter.  The overall work plan is underpinned by the objective of delivering benefits to end users, as outlined in the use cases of the Annex A.

Work Plan: 
The work plan will be implemented through a set of interconnected activities outlined below. Categories exist only for planning and pragmatic purposes; they are not at all independent and activities will not be siloed.  Cross-category contributions by working group members will be the norm.

Data Granularity WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/data-granularity-wg,yes,"The Data Granularity Task Force of the Data Discovery Paradigms Interest Group (DDPIG) of
the Research Data Alliance (RDA) proposes to form an RDA Data Granularity Working Group
(WG). This WG would address issues of data granularity in data discovery, access,
interoperability, analysis, citation, and more. More efficient and effective reuse of data requires
that users can find and access data at various levels of granularity. The WG will explore key
questions and collect and share valuable information for how to best support data granularity,
providing guidance to help data professionals to determine the best level of granularity for user
discovery, access, interoperability and citability. The activities and final recommendations of the
Data Granularity WG will build upon and complement existing and ongoing work of several RDA
Working and Interest Groups that touch upon the subject of data granularity. The final
Case Statement: RDA Data Granularity Working Group, Version 2, 6 July 2021
2
deliverable for the WG is a set of collected use cases and a guidance document of data
granularity approaches for prioritized use cases, including terminology, methods to evaluate
approaches, and a summary of community feedback.
2. Value Proposition
Data infrastructure is generally built around predefined levels of aggregation for datasets and
collections, for which conventions vary from one repository to the next. Multiple well-defined
levels of granularity can optimize:
? Discovery (by finding the specific data of interest): Enabling discovery at well-defined
and multiple levels of granularity can streamline how users navigate. Systems with too
low granularity are flooded with entries, especially if these are not grouped by duplicates.
This can severely limit the usefulness of the search function. However, when granularity
is too high, entries with low granularity are not discoverable by the system, and other
ways must be found to enable users to find what they need efficiently. Furthermore, If
repositories and/or domains clearly document and organize datasets in a consistent
manner, the barrier for new users and interdisciplinary research is reduced.
? Access (by retrieving only the data needed): Ideally, data access can be streamlined to
return the specific datasets that the user is requesting, utilizing dataset subsetting and
concatenating features which leverage the underlying granularity structure. When
granularity is too low, users have to download a great number of datasets and try to fit
them together in order to achieve their goals. Conversely, when data granularity is too
high, users have to download too much data and then sift through it to get the content
that they need. What is too high or too low depends on the domain, discipline and the
individual research goal. Furthermore, requirements in the suitability of granularity in a
repository may vary between deposit, access, and other services, but repositories are
often uncertain as to how to make granularity decisions at these key points, and what
information to hand may inform this (e.g., usage statistics).
? Interoperability (by aligning with levels of granularity used in other systems):
Interoperability is important for repository networks with shared services or infrastructure,
and applications that seek to integrate datasets from multiple repositories. Moreover,
even if repositories would like to enable interoperability at a certain level of granularity,
the metadata required to do so is not always readily obtained upon deposit.
? Analysis (by readily supporting inputs and outputs of data processing): Choices for data
granularity levels should consider alignment with analysis tools and processes, such as
models and data processing routines, in order to streamline research and improve
provenance-chain capabilities. Analysis-ready data granularity choices are subject to the
type of analysis work being performed, but there are designated communities for which
the needs can be clearly articulated. This concept is particularly relevant to cloud-native
data repositories that aim to serve analysis-ready cloud optimized (ARCO) data.
Case Statement: RDA Data Granularity Working Group, Version 2, 6 July 2021
3
? Citability (by providing creditÑand further discoveryÑfor the specific data products
used): Data citation, which should be in accompaniment of a persistent identifier, needs
to be applied at suitable granularity levels to appropriately credit individuals and
organizations, precisely represent the data used, and enable interpretable usage
metrics. In terms of credit, a better understanding is needed to determine which
situations may or may not lead to having credit propagate between granularity levels.
The granularity at which citation is applied impacts the meaning of data usage metrics,
and the consistency of these decisions affects comparisons between them. Common
approaches are critical to distinguishing relative value of datasets. Citation also relates to
dataset versioning practices, explored by many RDA groups.
? Curation and Deposit (via both manual and automated workflows): Curation tools and
workflows have influenced data granularity decisions. In some cases, splitting data into
smaller datasets is more time consuming (e.g., lack of ability to clone metadata as a
starting point from a similar dataset, limited tools to associate related datasets together
into collections), and in other situations publishing smaller parts as they are ready is
more efficient. Researchers submitting their own datasets may have a greater tendency
to take the simplest approach to meet deposit requirements, as opposed to curators who
are attempting to facilitate data services that rely on granularity decisions. Quality
metrics and processes are hard to define without specifying the granularity level they
apply to. What may be appropriate for small scale measurements may be unreasonable
for large conglomerates of heterogeneous data sources and vice versa.
Rich information can be gained by working with data at various levels of granularity (e.g.,
collections, datasets , observations, and more). More efficient and effective reuse of data
requires that usersÑbe they humans or machinesÑcan work with data at various levels of
granularity. For example, within a data collection composed of a set of files, researchers could
explore within each file variables, geospatial layers, or individual observations. To enable these
levels of discovery, analysis, and citation, supporting greater granularity can include the creation
and support of metadata and persistent identifiers at various levels of granularity. At present,
some repositories support data granularity, e.g., the ability to discover, query, and access files
within a collection, layers in a complex file, or columns in a table.
The WG will collect and share valuable information for how to best support data granularity,
providing guidance to help data professionals to determine the best level of granularity for user
discovery, access, interoperability and citability. The WG also will explore key questions
regarding:
? optimal levels of granularity for varied usage contexts,
? storage and distribution of different levels of granularity,
? how should different levels of granularity (within the same dataset) be presented to the
user,
? relationships amongst levels and with other datasets,
? tracking the granularity of dynamically-generated data, and
Case Statement: RDA Data Granularity Working Group, Version 2, 6 July 2021
4
? common terminology for granularity concepts.
Given the integral, cross-cutting nature of granularity across a range of issues, a prime value of
the WG will be leveraging and building upon existing and ongoing RDA work amongst a range
of groups (see below).
The key beneficiaries of the WG activities are as follows:
Beneficiary Tangible Impacts
Data producers ? More efficient data management
? Greater ability to track value and use
of subsets of data
Data infrastructure providers (e.g.,
repositories)
? Enhanced user services
? Clarity on the levels of data granularity
on which to operate (for deposit,
storage, and access)
? Greater ease in exchange of subsets
of data (and metadata) with other
systems
Secondary data users ? Faster discovery and access of data
of interest
? Expanded research possibilities given
new ways to work with granular
datasets
The public ? Benefits from faster and more
sophisticated research produced
Additionally, the group has received endorsement from the following RDA Member
Organisations, for which its work will provide value:
UniversitŽ de Lorraine
The Lorraine University has been involved for several years in supporting researchers in
the management of their research data, notably through the creation of an institutional
repository. The outputs of the proposed working group would prove useful to foster
the use cases where citation and reuse of data require a more precise and exible level
than the dataset. The University believes that this topic is an important one for the
years to come, and fully supports the constitution of this working group.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Libraries
Case Statement: RDA Data Granularity Working Group, Version 2, 6 July 2021
5
The Data Granularity Task Force of the Data Discovery Paradigms Interest Group (DDPIG)
presents a compelling case for developing more comprehensive understandings and guidance
around issues of data granularity. As MIT LibrariesÕ organizational representative this work is
valuable to us as we continue to develop and refine our research data services and support
tools, such as an institutional research materials index. This work should also provide support to
MITÕs broader research community by increasing discovery and reuse, supporting new analysis
methods, and improving research efficiency. In addition, as the research data infrastructure
continues to evolve in the scholarly commons information space this work will enable better
pathways for reuse, citation, credit, and incentivization for FAIR and open research data. The
MIT Libraries would look forward to adopting the proposed deliverables in our Data
Management Services program where we work with the MIT research community on RDM
education, research technologies, and research data consultation and curation.
The German Data Forum (RatSWD) would look forward to the proposed deliverables and
support the dissemination to the research community.
A deeper understanding of data granularity is an important building block towards enhancing
data findability and thus crucial on the way to FAIR data. Therefore, the German Data Forum
(RatSWD), an organisational member of RDA, supports the establishment of the Data
Granularity Task Force within the Data Discovery Paradigms Interest Group (DDPIG) - which it
sees as the appropriate framework for addressing these issues.
By also linking up with the German Consortium for the Social, Behavioural, Educational, and
Economic Sciences (KonsortSWD) the working group can build upon existing competencies and
utilize synergies. At the same time, KonsortSWD provides an interdisciplinary space to align,
test, and practically implement the results of the working group.
3. Engagement with Existing Work in the Area
Engagement with Adjacent RDA Groups
The activities and final recommendations of the Data Granularity WG will complement the work
of several RDA Working and Interest Groups that touch upon the subject of data granularity and
present use cases. These RDA groups have been identified by scanning their aims and outputs,
of which the relevant WG/IG and outputs are listed in detail in Appendix A. The risk of
duplicating work is low as this preliminary search through the RDA outputs concluded that while
some of the outputs touch the topic of data granularity, none of the existing groups cover it in
detail or provide recommendations. Where relevant information is discovered, the WG will
leverage that work in its recommendations. In order to ensure communication between the
relevant active IGs/WGs, we will connect to the identified groups both by the respective mailing
lists, as well as by inviting members of the groups to join this WG calls (incl. Plenary sessions).
Case Statement: RDA Data Granularity Working Group, Version 2, 6 July 2021
6
Additionally, we will establish liaisons with adjacent RDA groups, especially in cases where
activities have a strong complementarity.
4. Work Plan
4.1. Final Recommendations
The final deliverable for the WG is a set of collected use cases and a guidance document of
data granularity approaches for prioritized use cases, including terminology, methods to
evaluate approaches, and a summary of community feedback.
4.2 Deliverables & Milestones
0-6 Months:
Define use cases: While some use cases were identified during preliminary work as a task team
prior to becoming an established working group, these need to be properly documented,
expanded and prioritized. A template for recording use cases will be identified as an early step
(such as those listed at
https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/research-data-collections-wg/wiki/research-data-collections-us
e-cases). Ideally, this work will be completed by around month 3.
Identify existing constraints within registries, metadata standards and relevant existing RDA WG
outputs where these data granularity concepts are applied. We will look to identify relevant
metadata fields, commonalities and differences, and issues. Some examples are listed below to
illustrate the types of information that will be examined.
? Registries examples:
? DataCite has relationships like ÔIsPartOfÕ that may provide the linkage between a
dataset and its parent collection
? IGSN has concept of hierarchical collections, samples and sub-samples
? OBIS has a schema denoted as OBIS-ENV-DATA that has archives organized
with events, occurrences (of marine organisms) and their related Ômeasurements
or factsÕ.
? RADAM gives DOI for queries on underlying databases, so they can be citable
? OpenCitations only registers data citations that use a DOI
? WDC for climate has very coarse granularity. CMIP6 data for IPCC reports has a
very fine granularity, which makes it hard to map between the two.
? General purpose repositories often donÕt have the expertise to decide upon an
appropriate granularity.
? Metadata standards examples:
? ISO 19115 includes a field for parentMetadata that can allow for hierarchical
relationships of datasets
Case Statement: RDA Data Granularity Working Group, Version 2, 6 July 2021
7
? DDI (Data Documentation Initiative) includes a variety of granularity levels, such
as variables and variable groups, and hierarchical relationships.
? RDA WG output examples:
? RDA Research Data Collections metadata schema
? Data Usage Metrics recommendations
Create and conduct a survey of the community to solicit:
? existing approaches to segmenting datasets and collections in repositories (e.g., what
levels of granularity are they operating at in different functions);.
? end user expectations for access and discovery; and
? known problems and issues from WG team members and related RDA groups (via
identified liaisons).
? Additionally, conduct an initial review to identify aspects of granularity from public
resources available on the repositories.
6-12 Months
? Summarize and analyze findings from the first 6 months.
? Collect additional data if necessary, and consolidate with the community through
targeted communication tools (webinars/gdoc/BoFs etc)
? Draft guidance paper which addresses prioritized problems/issues, survey results and
domain considerations.
12-18 Months
? Feedback will be solicited from relevant stakeholders on the draft guidelines (likely tools:
webinars, RDA Plenary sessions, google docs, surveys, comments on posts).
? If available, integrate outcomes of early adopters or pilot implementations that emerge
from the adoption plan.
? Finalize, publish and promote guidance paper.
4.3 Working Group Operations
The three co-chairs will share the responsibilities for organizing meetings and plenary sessions.
Specific task groups will be established to progress on identified deliverables, with leads that will
report progress at team meetings. Regular working group meetings will be conducted monthly in
two time zones to encourage international participation, using video conferencing and Google
drive meeting minutes. A mailing list will be used for asynchronous communications. Other tools
may be used for collaborating on and tracking deliverables.
Case Statement: RDA Data Granularity Working Group, Version 2, 6 July 2021
8
4.4 Community Engagement and Participation
Broader community engagement will be required at multiple stages, with the survey and draft
guidelines feedback being the most significant. The survey will be advertised to relevant RDA
WGs, the PID Forum (https://www.pidforum.org/), and other research data management mailing
lists/communities (e.g., ESIP, AGU ESSI, etc). Survey results and the draft guidelines will be
presented to get constructive feedback, with engagement details distributed to the same
communities as the survey. Feedback will be categorized, evaluated and considered for
integration.
5. Adoption Plan
The Granularity WG will define the key assumptions and concepts for data granularity, which will
be translated into guidelines and best practices for capturing data granularity for their
widespread adoption across the different stakeholders in the data lifecycle; data producers, data
curators, data managers and data users are among the key roles that stand to gain. The WG
will engage with these communities at national, disciplinary, and international levels.
The WG will organise dissemination about the activities and findings and gather community
feedback regularly during all the phases of the work. To promote transparency and accessibility
of work in progress, the group members may utilise a public GitHub repository for WG
collaborative documents. The following table details the engagement that will be undertaken
towards relevant milestones, including final adoption.
Milestone Engagement
1 Identify issues in definition of data
granularity (domain agnostic and
domain specific), based on analysis
of existing definitions and
frameworks.
As per survey in above Work Plan.
2 Draft plan of guidelines, including
identification of use cases, and
community consultation on
guidelines.
After gathering use cases and reviewing
challenges regarding the granularity aspect, the
WG will produce a draft best practices

RDA / TDWG Metadata Standards for attribution of physical and digital collections stewardship,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/metadata-standards-attribution-physical-and-digital-collections-stewardship.html,yes,"This working group (WG) will address the incomplete standards for giving attribution for the
maintenance, curation, and digitization of collections. Within the scope of the WG, collections
can include digital data and digital/physical objects. This WG will produce use cases from a
variety of disciplines that will be used to create the final deliverable Ð an attribution metadata
schema. Adopters will include stewards of collections (such as the Natural History Museum
London) and aggregators of professional research metrics (such as ImpactStory ).
2. Value Proposition
Research collections are an important tool for understanding the Earth, its systems, and human
interaction. These collections are very diverse and can include preserved natural history
specimens, archeological artifacts, or historical documents, to name just a few. Maintaining and
curating these collections requires a large investment of time and money by institutions and
many individuals. Knowledge is created from collections by many individuals over time,
building on the work of others. For maximum efficiency, work needs to be shared broadly,
recorded permanently, and tasks not repeated unnecessarily. Unfortunately, the current research
cyberinfrastructure does not support this level of efficiency.
Despite the importance of collections, many are not maintained or curated as thoroughly as they
should. Part of the reason for this is the lack of professional reward for curatorial actions. Most
of the researchers who are qualified to curate a collection are too busy performing activities that
will reap professional reward, such as publication and grantwriting.
Proper methods of
attribution (at the individual and institutional level) are very important for incentivizing
digitization, mobilization. And sharing of data deriving from collections (physical and digital).
One strategy for incentivizing physical and digital collection curation is to create infrastructure
for attributing curatorial actions. Several programs exist for aggregating metrics for research
products other than publication, such as ImpactStory, OpenVIVO, Collector, and A ltmetrics.
Thus, there is already infrastructure in place for aggregating these data, if the einfrastructure
for
creation of these data is available.
Significant investment has been made in creating infrastructure components for data integration
across a wide variety of disciplines. Many of these components are lists, repositories, or other
structures that must be populated with data either by a person or algorithmically. Even an
automaticallycreated
data set will require some degree of human curation to ensure quality.
Often, very little can be completed without initial work by a person to create reference material.
This humancomponent
is a major bottleneck. Thus, existing infrastructure for collective
resources are not being populated with data and thus are not maximally useful. One way to
widen the bottleneck is to create professional incentives for researchers to contribute to
maintaining and curating collections. If people could get professional credit for improving a
classification, for example, it would be much easier for them to dedicate the time required. The
problem is that there is no good way to manage information about curatorial actions so that
curators can get professional credit.
The goal of this WG is to develop an attribution data schema (in collaboration with adopters and
with use cases from several disciplines) that can make getting credit for curation, maintenance,
and digitization of a collection as easy as getting credit for a publication. The deliverables of this
WG will benefit institutions that maintain collections and individuals who curate them and will
lead to:
? Improved recognition of the immense effort required for maintaining, curating, and
sharing collections, which is likely to lead to increased funds for these activities
? Increased efficiency in knowledge generation from collections through the proper
documentation of corrections and analyses performed
? Increased viability of crowdsourcing as a model for building collaborative research
resources
? Increased relevance of existing einfrastructure
that is being stifled by the expert
annotation bottleneck
3. Engagement with existing work in the area
Most institutions that maintain collections of physical items employ, or are moving towards, a
central Collections Management System (CMS) to support digital object curation. Certain
information about personal contribution to digital activities can often be assembled from the
generic database audit trail incorporated into these systems. However, the primary function of
these structures is to support system and workflow requirements, so are rarely able to provide
complete and accurate attribution metadata, and can only reflect digital rather than physical
effort. There is therefore a strong case for an attribution metadata schema which these systems
could adopt as part of their data model and workflows. Several vocabularies have been
developed specifically for recording provenance information (P ROVO) , for recording
information about physical samples (I GSN) , and for describing contributor roles (T aDiRAH,
CRediT, O penRIF) . In addition, several domainspecific
standards provide methods for giving
attribution for a physical object, data set, or data product (T DWG, E SIP, S ESAR, C ODATA,
COPDESS, etc.). None of these standards provides a method for recording specific curatorial
actions on a physical/digital object, digital data set, or data product. All of these existing
standards provide pieces of a system that, with some additional work, could make attribution and
professional reward for curatorial actions possible. This WG will strive to ensure interoperability
between its recommendations and existing schema.
The PID (Persistent Identifier) Collections WG, which currently has its case statement in review,
is potentially very relevant to the work we propose. Briefly, this group will develop
collectionslevel
metadata and specifications for an API. This WG will be more focused on
developing metadata for individual objects within a collection rather than collectionlevel
metadata, but we will collaborate with this group to ensure that our schema are interoperable.
The Metadata Standards WG and Interest Group (IG) are very relevant to the goals of this
proposed WG. We will provide a use case for these groups and align our schema with the
proposed metadata elements.
One group with whom we will be working very closely is IGSN, an organization that provides a
unique identifier for physical samples. This group started working primarily with geological
samples, but are now moving toward accommodating biological samples. We feel that their
initial metadata schema is a good starting point.
Museums, repositories, and other stewards of collections are always working hard to maintain
and curate their collections for maximum use. This WG will be pursuing these institutions as
adopters and working closely with them to investigate largescale
viability of solutions they have
implemented as well as ensuring WG deliverables will be useful to them.
In order to have a true impact on the social aspect of professional reward, the WG deliverables
need to ensure that data within the schema can be used by professional metrics aggregators such
as ImpactStory. We will work closely with this project to make sure that their system can handle
our products. One important difference between this WG and other efforts is the focus on outputs
that result in actionable metrics.
4. Work plan

6. Operational Policies
6.1. WG mode and frequency of operation
This WG will hold inperson
meetings at RDA plenaries as well as TDWG meetings. Also
virtual meetings will be held every month. Virtual meetings will be recorded and posted for
interested parties who could not attend. Every three months a short report on activity will be
requested by the WP leaders and circulated to all members of the WG. A ll WPs will be
supported through a wiki, a developer forum, and mailing lists.
6.2. Plans to develop consensus, address conflicts, and stay on track
All meetings will be kept on track by having an agenda, action items, and deadlines for those
action items. The deadlines will not be flexible. In the event that there is still a lot of open
discussion as a deadline approaches, the state of discussion will be reported in the corresponding
deliverable. Consensus will be reached via open discussion and voting as appropriate. It is the
responsibility of the WG leaders to build consensus through structured moderation. If a conflict
cannot be resolved within the WG, the RDA council will be consulted and an independent party
will be brought in to mediate. The WG will avoid mission creep by sticking to the project plan as
outlined above. Appointed moderators and WG leaders will enforce focused discussion by, for
example, splitting forum threads as appropriate
6.3. Broader community engagement and participation plan
This WG will hold working meetings and joint meetings at every RDA plenary. The monthly
meetings will be open to any interested party regardless of WG membership. Notes, slides, and
recorded meetings will be made available on the RDA website. The wikis and forums will be
open."
Metadata Standards Catalog WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/metadata-standards-catalog-working-group.html,yes,"Updated 15 January 2016 in response to TAB review

A concise articulation of what issues the WG will address within a 12-18 month time frame and what its “deliverables” or outcomes will be.

The Metadata Standards Catalog (MSC) Working Group will produce a catalog of metadata standards of relevance to research data. Specifically, the catalog system will consist of the following components:

    A set of records describing metadata standards

By ‘metadata standard’ we mean a defined metadata structure and format used within a community. Some metadata standards have formal standardization status but this is not necessarily an indication of quality or utilization.

    A user interface for submitting information, searching, browsing and displaying standards information
    A machine-to-machine interface (API) allowing automated tools to submit information, perform queries and retrieve information from the catalog

In this sense the catalog will be ‘machine readable’. We also intend that the information provided through the API will be structured in such a way that the recipient machine will be able to process and act upon it; in this sense the catalog will also be ‘machine actionable’.

This work builds on the outputs of the Metadata Standards Directory Working Group: both the Metadata Standards Directory (MSD) itself and the set of attendant use cases. The advances to be made by the MSC Working Group beyond that work are improvements to the data structure of the records, an improved user interface, and the addition of an API. The latter development will enable the MSC to participate in and provide services to any autonomic e-research fabric. While the base set of records for the MSC will be derived from those in the MSD, further information will be sought from discipline-specific standards directories and RDA working groups.

Value Proposition

A specific description of who will benefit from the adoption or implementation of the WG outcomes and what tangible impacts should result.

Prediction is very difficult, especially if it's about the future. — Neils Bohr

The primary beneficiaries of this work – being a continuation of work performed by the MSD Working Group and the UK Digital Curation Centre – will be researchers, in the following ways:

    Early career researchers, or those unused to sharing their data, will be able to consult the MSC – whether directly or indirectly through other tools – and discover an appropriate standard to use when documenting their data. This will help them to comply with funder requirements for data management from the planning stages through to submission to an archive.
    Having a comprehensive catalogue of metadata standards will make it easier to prevent duplication of standards development effort (in areas where metadata standards already exist) and highlight gaps where standards development activity is needed.
    Following on from the above, it will therefore be easier for peer researchers to discover, validate and reuse datasets that have been shared, due to the expected metadata being in place.

The group recognizes that there exist catalogs of datasets, repositories, software and publications with limited metadata for each entry. There exists the BioSharing initiative for bioscience and DataONE in environmental sciences, and beyond them many projects and initiatives with some information on relevant datasets and metadata associated with them. While these all contribute to the above benefits, in each case the information available is only covering one or a few domains; and in the case of BioSharing, intended for human not machine action. The MSC will address both these shortcomings with respect to metadata standards for research data.

More specific and tangible benefits and impacts of the MSC will be identified and targeted as part of the work plan. Use cases continue to be collected by the existing RDA metadata groups, the Metadata Interest Group (MIG), Metadata Standards Directory Working Group (MSDWG), and Data in Context Interest Group (DICIG). These, along with use cases to be collected directly by MSC Working Group, will be used as a basis for the precise use cases to be addressed by the MSC and the information it will contain. The following are a few examples:

    Researchers and research support staff will be able to discover standards relevant to the researcher’s discipline.
    Researchers will be able to browse the catalog for standards in other disciplines that may be appropriate, perhaps to facilitate interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary work.
    Developers of tools such as DMPTool or DMPonline will be able to use information from the MSC, via the API, to suggest relevant standards to researchers.
    Systems will be able to look up, via the API, the converters available for unfamiliar standards, to reduce the friction of importing metadata from other systems.
    In the long term, the MSC may be able to provide information to enable repository software to provide tailored metadata input forms on-the-fly, or to generate a matching between standards that a developer could use as a starting point for a converter.

The medium term goal, however, is to analyze the metadata standards and use cases and generate – working with and through MIG – a set of proposed ‘packages’ of metadata elements for purposes drawn from the wider set of use cases. By ‘packages’ we mean groupings of metadata elements for particular purposes, such as discovery, contextualization, or detailed connection of software to data. For clarity, please note the following:

    Each element may not be a single-valued attribute but a structure.
    There are relationships between elements including those carrying referential and functional integrity.
    Elements may belong to more than one package.

Since the packages represent functions, one possible naming scheme would Function Package with a specific function represented as Function Package: Discovery. The packages describe here differ from application profiles. Application profiles are a mapping from a given data structure to that required for a particular application (business purpose). These packages are generic. The packages so generated will be useful for those writing converters, designing systems and considering new standards. In the longer term they may form the bais of novel presentations of schemas and specifications for metadata standards.

The information that the catalog will need to hold about each standard will depend on the use cases chosen for the MSC, but we anticipate it will include information on the schema/specification, converters available, associated vocabularies (on which collaboration with the Vocabulary Services Interest Group would be useful), associated tools, examples of services with expertise in the standard, the version history of the standard, and the provenance (source, date last updated, etc.) of the records themselves.

Engagement with existing work in the area

A brief review of related work and plan for engagement with any other activities in the area.

The only source of knowledge is experience. — Albert Einstein

The work of MSC Working Group will build on the outputs of the RDA MSD Working Group, as outlined in the case statement for that group. The group will engage with several actively maintained domain-specific standards directories:

    Marine Metadata Interoperability Content Standard References: the MSD Working Group co-chairs have already initiated discussions with John Graybeal (Mindspring).
    GEOSS Standards and Interoperability Registry
    BioSharing: the MSD Working Group co-chairs have already initiated discussions with Susanna-Assunta Sansone (University of Oxford).
    Community Inventory of EarthCube Resources for Geosciences Interoperability: the MSD Working Group co-chairs have already initiated discussions with Ilya Zaslavsky (SDSC).

The group will engage with other RDA groups with an interest in metadata standards:

    Wheat Data Interoperability Working Group
    Metadata IG
    Data in Context IG
    Data Fabric IG
    Practical Policy WG
    Brokering Governance WG
    Brokering IG
    ELIXIR Bridging Force IG
    Data Description and Interoperability WG
    Research Data Provenance IG
    Domain Repositories IG

The group will engage with other external activities with an interest in identifying and producing metadata standards:

    NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K)
    FORCE11 FAIR Data Principles

Work Plan

A specific and detailed description of how the WG will operate.

M1-M6: Continue to collect use cases for interaction with the proposed catalog including both human access/interaction and machine access/interaction. Analyze these (using the MIG template presented at RDA Plenary 6) for intersections and synergies leading to a definition of the requirements and technical specification for the catalog.

M6-M12: Do initial design and development of the Catalog system prototype based on already collected use cases, defined requirements and technical specifications using best practices in metadata standards to describe metadata standards and their relationships to organisations, persons, software, datasets, etc. thereafter taking into account later-arriving use cases refine to the production catalog system. Cooperate with other RDA Groups (especially domain groups) in refining the prototype system to production status leading to adoption. Identify potential adopters of the Catalog system.

M12-M18: Evaluate the catalog against requirements and technical specifications with and by application domain communities of RDA and other potential adopters. Validate the Catalog mechanisms for directing users to metadata standard(s) appropriate to their purposes.

M14-M16: During this period of time the packages will be documented; standards to the catalog will be inputted ""as they are""; a priority list of standards for mapping will be established by the community; the high priority standard swill be mapped to the packages; the mapping will be stored in the catalog; and a user interface and API to the catalog will be provided

M18: Report at next RDA Plenary

Final Deliverables

The form and description of final deliverables of the WG.

A catalog for metadata standards, incorporating

    User interfaces for input/edit/query/reporting
    Appropriate APIs for software interaction with the catalog
    Mechanisms for directing users to metadata standards appropriate to their purposes.

Milestones and Intermediate Deliverables

The form and description of milestones and intermediate documents, code or other deliverables that will be developed during the course of the WG’s work

    One or more white papers to stimulate discussions and steer group activities (M3, M9)
    Requirements and technical specification for the MSC, to serve as the foundation for software development (M6)
    Contributions to the MIG objective of defining ‘packages’ of metadata elements for defined purposes (M12)

Mode and Frequency of Operation

A description of the WG’s mode and frequency of operation (e.g. on-line and/or on-site, how frequently will the group meet, etc.).

The WG will provide the usual forum for discussion through teleconferences/Skypes (every three months), face-to-face meetings between plenaries associated with group chair meetings, face-to-face meetings at plenaries (twice a year), meetings at plenaries with other groups (especially the metadata groups but also others) and the RDA website forum as appropriate. However, the major mechanism of operation is the provision of software to encourage input/edit and utilisation of metadata standards.

Operational Policies

A description of how the WG plans to develop consensus, address conflicts, stay on track and within scope, and move forward during operation

The proposed co-chairs have extensive experience of project management generally and also within the RDA context due to participation in other groups. They have already demonstrated their ability to manage groups. Working from the agreed plan, all group members will participate in discussions on realization of the objectives and the means to do so. Consensus will be developed by frequent online (teleconference or email/forum) discussions mediated by one or more of the co-chairs. This mechanism will also achieve conflict resolution by exposing the different viewpoints and – through discussion – converging to consensus. The milestones defined above provide the anchorage to a timeline and the deliverables will be concrete proof of adherence to the timeline.

Community Engagement Plan

A description of the WG’s planned approach to broader community engagement and participation.

Potentially all RDA groups should be engaged and participate by contributing to this WG. The WG plans to provide advice and assistance upon request especially to domain-based groups enquiring about metadata standards. In particular the groups listed above (Engagement with Existing Work) will be involved in shaping the work of the proposed MSC Working Group acting both as requirements stakeholders and validators of the deliverables.

Adoption Plan

A specific plan for adoption or implementation of the WG outcomes within the organizations and institutions represented by WG members, as well as plans for adoption more broadly within the community. Such adoption or implementation should start within the 12-18 month timeframe before the WG is complete.

In order to ensure the eventual functionality and the APIs of the MSC are maximally useful, the WG will consult with potential adopters, including tool developers, research data management support staff when compiling and evaluating against the requirements and technical specification (see Work Plan above). Entries may also be synchronized with peer standards catalogues, such as the DCC Disciplinary Metadata catalogue. "
Research Metadata Schemas WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/research-metadata-schemas-wg,yes,"The widespread use of schema.org1, DCAT2 and other vocabularies in web pages to add structured metadata describing research data has brought new opportunities for making these outputs FAIRer. The opportunities include, but are not limited to:
1) Leveraging robust commercial search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing etc. to facilitate broader discovery of, and access to, research data;
2) Providing a common set of vocabularies to describe research resources, enabling improved metadata interoperability across data repositories, increasing re-use and sharing of captured metadata;
3) Providing a potentially new method for metadata/content syndication among data catalogues and registries, enabling federated search across resources of a specific domain, or related domains relevant to a research need.
However, these opportunities also come with new challenges. Schema.org provides a core, minimalistic vocabulary for describing the kind of entities that most common web applications need. By design, schema.org expects, and has enabled, domains of practice to extend this core (Guha et al, 2016). Like other domains of practice, research data communities have their own needs for extending this core to describe research data and its relationships to other resources. These extensions include specific data types and the properties they possess, domain relevant and type specific to persistent identifiers, etc. There are some communities that are addressing these issues and have planned extensions to the core of schema.org to meet their own community needs, for example, bioschemas.org3 for life science, and science-on-schema.org4 for earth and environmental science. According to our recent survey5 that was carried out by the Data Discovery Paradigms IG, more data repositories are following a similar route by either implementing structured markups in metadata landing pages, or else with planned extensions of schema.org in one way or another.
This proposed working group will provide a platform to complement, build on and extend efforts from bioschema.org, science-on-schema.org and the like communities in applying and extending the core schema.org vocabulary for describing research datasets and related resources (e.g. workflow, software, researchers, etc.). The objectives of this work group are twofold:
1. to identify and bridge gaps in existing schemas commonly used for research data, by bringing together communities who are working with such vocabularies to document research data and related resources;
1 https://schema.org/
2 DCAT: https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/
3 https://bioschemas.org/
4 Science on schema: https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/
5 Survey summary: Current practices in using schemas to describe research datasets: http://bit.ly/2JZxXjK
2. to provide guidelines for those communities whose needs are not addressed by existing metadata schema such as schema.org, and provide guidelines on proposing extensions.
The planned outputs will include:
1. A generic Ôconceptual data modelÕ with essential types and properties for research data discovery over the web. The model will be built on bioschemas.org, science-on-schema.org, schema.org, DCAT, DDI-DISCO6 and SSN7 schemas from some representative research domains, and data discovery use cases. A research domain can map their schema to the conceptual model when they publish data to the web or exchange metadata between data portals/repositories.
2. A guideline, illustrated with common patterns, of common patterns for publishing metadata landing pages with structured data markups; and a guideline of how to customise the research schemas for target domains with examples.
3. Toolings for making the implementation easier if resources are available. This could include collecting and cataloguing tools that generate, validate and parse schema.org & DCAT markup, etc.
Value proposition
It is expected the proposed work will benefit a range of data stakeholders as follows:
Data providers and data catalogue managers:
? The conceptual data model and the guidelines will help data providers and data catalogue managers to implement structured metadata markups and have their data more findable by data seekers/consumers.
? Being able to adopt or map to a common research schema will make it possible for metadata from one catalogue to be more interoperable with, and reusable by, other data catalogues.
Data seekers:
? It will benefit data seekers/consumers for effective and efficient data search via faceted search and filtering, or other opportunities of either human or machine APIs built on combination of structured data search and keyword search.
? It will also make it easier for people to publish info about datasets and thus increase the range of datasets that are discoverable.
? Since all research data is expected to have some common properties, this work will make it possible to describe these common properties, and standard means through which they can be exposed for discovery.
Data technologies:
? When there is a common way to describe metadata across data catalogues, it provides opportunity for developing applications such as federated search either vertically to a
6 https://www.ddialliance.org/Specification/RDF/Discovery 7 https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/
discipline or across different disciplines based on research needs, applications that can support a spectrum of data search needs from free text search to SPARQL queries.
Engagement with existing work in the area
The proposed work will be built on existing work of bioschema.org, science-on-schema.org, and a number of mappings to and from schema.org as identified from our recent survey8 (e.g. DCAT to schema.org9, DCAT-AP to schema.org10, ISO 19115 to schema.org11). We will also reference data models and schemas from ISO and W3C recommended standards such as DCAT, which is currently being updated. Through exploration of existing work, we will identify common elements across research domains and domain specific elements as well.
The group will work with and encourage collaborations with other RDA WGs/IGs. In particular, we will examine closely the outputs from previous RDA WGs and IGs, including:
? Data Description Registry Interoperability (DDRI) WG
? Research Data Collections WG
? Research Data Repository Interoperability WG
? Metadata Interest Group (MIG)
? Preservation Tools, Techniques and Policies
? (more may be identified É)
The data models and types proposed from these WGs and IGs may directly benefit from the proposed work of this group, which is to extend core schema.org vocabulary to include more essential research resources for discovery and re-use of data.
The group will engage with existing RDA WGs/IGs for clear definition of data types and terms, including:
? Data Type Registries WG & #2
? Data in Context IG
? Domain Repositories IG
? (more may be identified É)
The group will seek to collaborate with domain specific RDA WGs/IGs, for example, International Materials Resource Registries WG and Marine Data Harmonisation IG, these groups could be potential adopters of recommendations from this group.

Working group operation, communication and engagement
The group has set up a regular meeting every four week to communicate, discuss and get feedback from group members. Advance notice of each meeting will be sent to the groupÕs mailing list, meeting notes and relevant documents will be made available from the groupÕs wiki page at the RDA website.
We have a plan to organise group sessions at RDA plenaries, will be communicating and promoting the work to communities outside of RDA, and most importantly, we will take feedback and seek consensus to ensure the outputs are in line with community needs.
Apart from having four co-chairs, the group would also like to have a technical advisory group with members representing different standard bodies and disciplines from within and outside of RDA. Chairs and the advisory group will meet regularly (2~3 months) to review work in progress and resolve any technical and engagement issues as they arise.
We will have terms of reference for co-chairs, so each co-chair is aware her/his responsibility and RDA principles of openness and diversity inclusiveness. When there are disagreements and conflicts among co-chairs and group members, co-chairs will ensure different viewpoints are discussed and presented, and work with members and communities to achieve consensus.
Co-chairs of this WG have representatives from domains of life science and earth and environmental science, which have already adopted and extended schema.org. Their participation will ensure lessons learnt and outputs produced from the two communities will be carried over to the WG and the two communities will be consulted and engaged with the latest developments. Co-chairs also include a representative from a potential adopter Ð the Research Data Australia portal (run by Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC)). ARDC will not only likely adopt the outputs from the WG but also promote outputs to their Australia data providers and international partners such as Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information.
Adoption plan
ELIXIR and ESIP semantics technologies cluster have been working with life science community and earth and environmental science community on adoption of bioschema.org and science-on-schema.org respectively. The effort from the two communities on extension of the schema and guidelines and training on their respective adoption process have laid the foundation for this WG to work on. Having a representative from each of the two communities as co-chair of this WG shows the two communities will support, be engaged, and very likely adopt the conceptual model and guidelines from the WG.
Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) runs a national data catalogue. The catalog (Research Data Australia) harvests metadata from 101 research organisations from around
Australia. ARDC is exploring how to improve global data discovery by providing optimised national aggregation point for syndication to global information systems (e.g. search engines, Scholix, and vertical discipline portals etc). It is likely that the outputs from the working group will be evaluated and adopted, as the outcome from the working group aligns with the direction ARDC is exploring.
The Arctic Data Committee (ADC) is an international body whose members come from data centers that hold polar data of any kind. Its purpose is to Òpromote and facilitate international collaboration towards the goal of free, ethically open, sustained and timely access to Arctic data through useful, usable, and interoperable systemsÓ. The ADC is comprised of members of the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC), the Sustaining Arctic Observing Networks program (SAON), and Standing Committee on Antarctic Data Management (SCADM). During a meeting in Geneva last fall, the ADC community unanimously agreed that adopting structured metadata ˆla schema.org was in the communityÕs best interest. As a result, they are awaiting the results of this WG in order to guide development. Towards that end, they have appointed a liaison to this community, both to provide input and to take outputs back for implementation.
The WG chairs and members of technical advisory group will actively engagement communities in and out of RDA to promote the output and encourage more adoptions."
Persistent Identification of Instruments WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/persistent-identification-instruments-wg,yes,"The Persistent Identification of Instruments RDA Working Group (PIDINST WG) seeks to
propose a community-driven solution for globally unique and unambiguous identification of
instruments instances that are operational in the sciences.
In her recent book, entitled ÒBig Data, Little Data, No DataÓ [1], Christine Borgman writes ÒTo
interpret a digital dataset, much must be known about the hardware used to generate the data,
whether sensor networks or laboratory machines.Ó Borgman further highlights that ÒWhen
questions arise [...] about calibration [...], they sometimes have to locate the departed student or
postdoctoral fellow most closely involved.Ó This is a striking account for the role information
about instruments plays in science and the costs of not being able to find and access such
information.
The need to uniquely identify an instrument instance is rapidly growing in many research
communities. Indeed, persistent identifiers enable unambiguous reference to digital
representations of instruments, which has many potential benefits:
? Metrics that quantify the use of instruments and the rationale for future funding
? Link data to the instruments that generated them (provenance), improving the
interpretation and validity of data
? Aid equipment logistics and mission planning
? Facilitate interoperability and open data sharing, especially in advancing technologies
that foster sharing of instruments
? Improve the discoverability and visibility of instruments and their data, published on the
web.
Currently, there is no universal way to identify instrument instances. As the primary outcome,
PIDINST WG contributes to establishing a cross-discipline, operational solution for the unique
and lasting identification of active and decommissioned instruments. This case statement
outlines the work planned for PIDINST WG.
PIDINST WG Case Statement, v1.0 (2017-12-27)
https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/persistent-identification-instruments
Issues to be addressed
? Instruments as physical entities - What is an instrument? Implications of identifying the
instrument instance as a physical object versus identifying a digital information object
(metadata) about the instrument. What do instruments produce, their real-world
configurations, their relations to platforms and deployments, and the implications of
instrument modifications to identification (new versions).
? Granularity - Instruments can be parts of other (compound) instruments. For example,
instruments can be manufactured with multiple bespoke sensor components, such as
modular weather stations that simultaneously measure multiple meteorological variables.
The granularity at which to reference and describe instrument instances (compound
versus component) can vary for different stakeholders. How can these types of
instruments be described in a generic way.
? Use cases - Support the analysis of community requirements and inform the work
carried out by PIDINST WG.
? Metadata - Explore the types and sources of metadata that could be resolved under a
PID and the difference between metadata registered at PID infrastructure provider (e.g.
DataCite, ePIC, Crossref) vs. metadata at institutional instrument database provider.
Develop a minimum common metadata schema for the registration of instruments with
PID infrastructure providers.
? Machine readability, interoperability, and provenance - Investigate the need and the
requirements involved to make metadata (at the institutional level) machine readable and
compatible with existing interoperable technologies. Provenance, in particular the
relation between data and instruments that generated them, is another aspect to be
addressed.
? Landscaping - Explore the links, potential relationships and overlaps with instrument
manufacturers, institutional instrument database providers, RDA groups and PID
infrastructure providers.
Outcomes
The work of the PIDINST WG will contribute to the following outcomes. Note that these are
long-term outcomes this WG aims at contributing to. This WG will not build a sustainable
infrastructure for the persistent identification of instruments. It will merely contribute to specifying
such infrastructure. The concrete deliverables of this WG are presented in the Work Plan.
? A sustainable infrastructure will support the registration of instrument instances by
submitting metadata about them and allowing for minting an instrument instance PID.
The PID must follow agreed standards for persistent identifiers, e.g. long-lasting
actionable, descriptive digital identifiers.
? Improved understanding within research communities for how to describe instrument
instances, including relations to other entities such as instrument model (type) or
instrument deployment, the issue of identifying physical objects versus digital
representations, and other related issues.
? Collaborations with one or more PID infrastructure provider interested in implementing
the approach to persistent identification of instruments proposed by the PIDINST WG.
? Strong linkages to the activities of the RDA PID IG and other related RDA groups.
Value Proposition
Persistent identifiers provide a permanent reference to digital content that is resolvable over the
internet, including a digital description of a physical object. Once assigned to an instrument
instance, a PID will only ever apply to that particular instance - also beyond the instrument
instanceÕs lifetime. Therefore, communities will be able to unambiguously identify instrument
instances in their own applications or management systems, making it easier to manage assets.
When assigning a PID, the registrant links metadata with a level of detail appropriate to identify
a distinct entity within the PID system. Using a common set of metadata will make it easier to
share and collate information across disparate networks such as research e-infrastructures and
make it easier to automate processes. A PID resolves to a landing page containing more
detailed information about an instance, providing a permanent link to attributes such as its
characteristics and capabilities, which may evolve over time.
Individuals, communities and initiatives that will benefit
The key beneficiaries are stakeholders interested in using persistent identifiers for instruments,
specifically:
? Researchers: Persistent identification of instruments will enable linking datasets, and
metadata describing them, with the instrument instances involved in measuring
parameters. Unambiguous linking, additional attributes to PIDs, and PID resolution onto
landing pages will provide researchers contextual information needed to determine how
to appropriately process or interpret data.
? Data repositories: Data repositories already capture information about devices in
metadata of published datasets. For instance, the metadata of a dataset 1 published by
PANGAEA includes information about the device type used to measure temperature and
other parameters, namely ÒCTD, SEA-BIRD SBE 911plusÓ. PANGAEA links this
1 https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.807548
information to the corresponding vendor web page . In the future, such 2 linking could be
through PIDs and at the granularity of the device instance, rather than the type. A similar
case can be found at GEOFON, and other seismological data centres. GEOFON offers a
web service (FDSN station-WS) that provides metadata for datasets. These metadata
include information to convert data into physical units, and a description/specification of
the instrument types that recorded the data, but usually not the instrument instance. The
metadata follows an international standard format called StationXML, which will most
probably include in its future version the possibility to add persistent identifiers to relate
to entities external to the metadata content.
? Registries : There already exist registries that support the lookup of descriptions of
entities related to instrumentation. The ESONET Yellow Pages3 and the NERC
Vocabulary Server4 are examples of registries for sensing device types (models) or
terms more generally, and their descriptions. Such registries would benefit from
persistent identification of instruments since the identifiers can, e.g., be crosslinked with
identifiers representing entities related to instrument instances, e.g. instrument type.
? Hardware curators: Facilities, such as the National Oceanography CentreÕs National
Marine Equipment Pool (NMEP), are responsible for keeping track of an institutionÕs
instruments (or assets). For instance, the NMEP is responsible for the procurement,
maintenance, calibration and provision of equipment for research expeditions as well as
for providing crucial information for international custom authorities and insurance
purposes during shipping. Persistent identification will help manage such assets more
efficiently.
? Manufacturers: In addition to individual researchers, commercial manufacturers and
other institutions that manufacture instruments may be agents that register instruments
Òat birthÓ. In some cases, manufacturers may also maintain descriptive landing pages,
and thus the mapping of instrument PID with instrument landing page. Involvement of
(commercial) manufacturers can benefit these organizations by actively involving them in
downstream use of instruments as well as increased visibility and use of their services.
? PID infrastructure providers: By adopting the outcomes of this WG, PID infrastructure
providers can extend their service offering into a new object type.
? Funding bodies and institutions: Persistent identification of instruments is a building
block towards attributing data output to instruments and assessing the contribution of
instruments to science. Metrics for the ÒperformanceÓ of instruments (Òintense of useÓ)
will support funding bodies in allocating resources and allow institutions to demonstrate
the value of their instrument assets.
? Data management service providers: Providers of semantic sensor web publications
require resolvable identification of sensor descriptions that are universally unique in
order to support a global network of sensors. This was identified as a priority in a EU
report [3] on data management and standards for sensors.

? Research infrastructures : Especially operators of observatories with instruments but also
virtual research infrastructures. Simplified access to shared research infrastructure
instrument pools is a key requirement for national, European and multinational
infrastructures. Among other benefits, PIDs will facilitate inter-infrastructure loan
procedures.
Key impacts
? Enable a global registry of instruments following established practices and infrastructure
for the persistent identification of objects.
? Specification of a minimal metadata schema for the description of instruments to be
proposed for adoption by PID infrastructure providers, data centers, manufacturers, etc.
? Enable the unambiguous reference of instruments.
? Enable the cross-linking of instruments with data, articles, people and other entities.
? Enable the description of compound and component instruments.
? Enable reference to persistently identified instruments in scientific workflows as well as
in provenance metadata, and metadata more generally.
? Contribute to improving data quality and data fitness for reuse, FAIR data and metadata,
and trust in data: Computations typically need multivariate streams of data and
information about instruments is important for QC/QA, etc.
Engagement with existing work in the area
Persistent identifiers have a long history [2] and persistent identification predates the modern
approaches of actionable identifiers resolvable on the Web. Well known for the identification of
published literature, PIDs have been applied to an increasing number of entities, objects and
agents, digital and physical.
Increasingly popular is the application of DOI to persistently identify published data. Data
centers such as PANGAEA have long been collaborating with PID infrastructure providers, in
particular DataCite, to implement persistent identification of published data in practice, in
workflows researchers use.
More recently, the concept was also applied to physical objects, such as samples. A prominent
example is the International Geo Sample Number (IGSN). In addition, physical agents, such as
persons (ORCID) and organizations (ISNI) are also being identified. Much progress is being
made in cross-linking such identifiers, e.g. literature to data and data to data (Scholix5 [3]), as
well as literature or data to people, especially with the steady integration of ORCID in publishers
and data centers (see for instance [4]).
5 http://www.scholix.org/
By addressing instruments, PIDINST WG merely applies existing approaches for persistent
identification to yet another entity. Still, there is a need to get community agreement on how to
tackle the details that are specific to instruments. As such, the PIDINST WG can surely adopt
many existing ideas and approaches and adapt them to meet the characteristics and needs of
instrumentation.
While PIDINST WG focuses and limits its scope to instrument instances, the work relates to
registries for instrument models, such as the ESONET Yellow Pages or the NERC Vocabulary
Server. Such infrastructure can identify and describe models (types) and PIDINST WG will
evaluate the possibility of including a mechanism to link instrument instances to instrument type
descriptions.
PIDINST WG relates to systems such as the Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R), 6 a repository for
underway data collected during the deployment of research vessels, where data are linked to
instruments as they are deployed on vessels during cruises (research campaigns). Interestingly,
R2R utilizes DOI to identify cruises (i.e. deployments) and URI to identify instruments, e.g. the
Vaisala WXT520 metstation on Atlantis7. Another interesting example is the application of DOI
to identify seismic networks following the recommendations by the International Federation of
Digital Seismograph Networks. An example is the ÒSeismic network 5E: MINAS Project
(2011/2013)Ó identified by http://doi.org/10.14470/ab466166. The application of DOI to seismic
networks was seen as a way to tackle the problem of citation and proper attribution of
seismological datasets. The primary requirement is thus data citation.
The issue of providing attribution to instruments and their generated data has also been tackled
by creating journals that specialize on the publication of literature describing instruments. An
example for such a journal is the Journal of Large-Scale Research Facilities8 (JLSRF).
Finally, PIDINST WG relates to technology, including PID infrastructure providers, resolution
mechanisms, content negotiation, and metadata technologies such as OGC Sensor Web
Enablement9 (SWE), Semantic Sensor Network ontology10 (SSN), StationXML11 and CERIF12.
The use of PIDs to identify sensor web publications using SWE and SSN was identified as a
research priority in a joint EU report [5] from Ocean of Tomorrow projects, such as
SenseOCEAN13. PIDINST WG will address these technologies for persistent identification of
instruments.

Plan for engagement
PIDINST WG aims to engage a number of parties, most importantly representatives of PID
infrastructure providers and institutional instrument database providers, instrument
manufacturers, and relevant RDA groups. Such experts will ideally be directly involved in
PIDINST WG. It is primarily the task of the current WG members to actively reach out in their
communities and to represent PIDINST WG and its work, e.g. in presentations or direct
communication. If not engaged directly in PIDINST WG, the WG will maintain bilateral
discussions with these parties.
A key community for PIDINST WG to engage with are PID infrastructure providers, such as
DataCite, ePIC, IGSN and others. Some of these providers are already represented in PIDINST
WG (e.g. ePIC). Current PIDINST WG members have good personal connections to PID
infrastructure provider representatives and we plan to engage others actively early on in the
WGÕs development.
A second key community for PIDINST WG to engage with are institutional instrument database
providers. Such stakeholders are ultimately the managers of metadata about instruments and
the maintainers of landing pages providing such information, i.e. the resources onto which PIDs
identifying instruments will be resolved.
PIDINST WG aims at engaging selected manufacturers. This is arguably a difficult task but it
may be sufficient to engage a few in order to clarify the possible role manufacturers can play in
persistent identification of instruments (e.g. register instruments, maintain landing pages, etc.).
Some PIDINST WG members have contacts to manufacturers, or are manufacturers of some of
their own instruments. We are thus confident that we will be able to include the perspective of
manufacturers in PIDINST WG.
PIDINST WG plans to organize a WG session at each RDA Plenary during the WGÕs lifetime.
These will be the main face-to-face meetings in which to provide an update, make decisions,
and discuss the actions over the six-months period. PIDINST WG will also present its progress
in the RDA PID IG session at plenaries. Furthermore, PIDINST WG will engage with other
relevant RDA WGs and IGs, such as Small Unmanned Aircraft SystemsÕ Data IG or Collections
WG, in order to discover and explore synergies. Such engagement is primarily done via joint
sessions at plenaries and joining conference calls. Individuals may also utilize regular
conferences to organize informal meetings.
Much of the work on engaging these communities will be critically important for the adoption of
PIDINST WG deliverables.
Work Plan
Deliverables
Firstly, the PIDINST WG will deliver a white paper on persistent identification of instruments
aimed at PID infrastructure providers. This document is a recommendation. The white paper
informs PID infrastructure providers in their decision to implement persistent identification of
instrument and supports them in the implementation. The document is a result of the work done
by PIDINST WG and presents the information collected and developed by the WG during its
lifetime. In particular, it will report on cross-community use cases and formulate requirements for
PID infrastructure providers based on these use cases.
An important component of the white paper is the proposed schema for metadata about
instruments, which PID infrastructure providers may want to consider for instrument registration.
This schema will be developed in a suitable format, e.g. XML, and will be available online (e.g.
GitHub) as well as documented in the white paper.
Secondly, the PIDINST WG will deliver a white paper on its deliberations regarding the
publishing of metadata about instruments by institutional instrument database providers. This
document is a technical report. It may cover a wide range of topics, including metadata schema,
linking data, content negotiation.
Milestones
Assuming timely formal endorsement by the RDA, the PIDINST WG will hold its kick-off meeting
at P11 in Berlin, March 21-23, 2018. Each following Plenary during the WGÕs lifetime (M1-M18)
is considered to be a milestone since the meeting will be an opportunity to (1) update the
community on the WGÕs progress; (2) address and resolve open issues; and (3) plan the actions
to be taken over the following six-months period.
The PIDINST WG will reach a milestone with the engagement of one or more manufacturers.
Manufacturers should be involved into the discussions and development, either directly at
physical or virtual meetings, or otherwise in bilateral communication. The PIDINST WG will
reach another milestone with the engagement of one or more PID infrastructure providers
interested in adopting the WGÕs results. Similarly to manufacturers, PID infrastructure providers
are preferably involved directly in discussions and development but will otherwise be involved
via bilateral communication. Both stakeholders should be involved as early as possible in the
WGÕs lifetime.
Primarily during the first three months (M1-M3), and extending at least into M9, the WG will
collect use cases through engaging relevant stakeholders. Two use cases are already available
and a couple more are planned. The WG will discuss and analyse these use cases in order to
draw requirements, primarily for PID infrastructure providers. At the end of M3, the WG will have
a description of the requirements.
During M1-M6, the WG will develop and present for community review a first metadata schema.
A first draft should be published ahead of M6 in order to allow for review by the next Plenary
(P12). The metadata schema for PID infrastructure providers will be presented at the P12
meeting (M6).
In addition to revision and continued improvements to the metadata schema for PID
infrastructure providers, during M6-M12 the WG will focus on publishing metadata about
instruments by institutional instrument database providers. It will further engage stakeholders, in
particular PID infrastructure providers, manufacturers, and institutional instrument database
providers to catalyse (1) adoption of the proposed schema and (2) gain further requirements for
institutional systems that describe instrument instances. At the P13 meeting (M12), the WG will
provide an update on the metadata schema (changes) and present the results on its
deliberations regarding publishing metadata about instruments by institutional instrument
database providers.
During M12-M18, the WG will continue its work to catalyse adoption of the proposed schema
with PID infrastructure providers as well as complete and publish the deliverables, specifically
the recommendation to PID infrastructure providers and the technical report for institutional
instrument database providers. The WG will have a final meeting at P14 (M18). Figure 1
provides an overview of the major milestones and deliverables.
Operation
The PIDINST WG will meet physically at RDA Plenary meetings (P11, P12, P13) during its 18
months lifetime. These meetings will serve as a platform to present and discuss results, address
and resolve open issues, and to plan the following six-months phase.
Depending on the size of the community attending conference calls, the WG will organize
monthly conference calls for the whole group as well as monthly conference calls for a technical
subgroup . The conference calls will be organized every two weeks on a 14 day and time fixed
during the kick-off meeting. The group conference calls are intended to update the community
and obtain feedback. The technical subgroup conference calls are intended to drive forward the
work.
Consensus and conflicts
PIDINST WG plans to develop consensus by encouraging and ensuring participation in
meetings, both virtual and physical meetings. PIDINST WG encourages offline thinking and
work ahead of conference calls and active discussion during calls in order to draw from a wide
14 If there is no substantial difference in members between the technical subgroup and the whole group,
the WG will organize monthly conference calls and additional intermediate calls on demand.

range of ideas. This should ensure that team members are heard and acknowledged and that
the development is not biased toward the thinking of a few members.
If required, PIDINST WG will vote on issues. The WG will adopt a weighted multi-vote approach
whereby each member can cast up to three votes, from most to least preferred. This approach
ensures members think thoroughly about the available options and decreases chances of
stalemate.
The co-chairs are committed to keep the development on track and within scope. The WG will
adopt a framework for ranking priorities that helps the team deciding which option will best
qualify priorities. We will also undertake regular retrospectives (such as after completing a
milestone) where we assess our performance and feedback improvements into the next phase.
Community engagement
The PIDINST WG will engage in particular the following broader communities: Research
infrastructures that operate observatories with instruments, data centers, other relevant RDA
WGs or IGs, as well as relevant international projects.
National, pan-European, and international research infrastructures that operate instruments are
an important and interesting community to engage in this work. Many current PIDINST WG
members are either members of one or more research infrastructures or have personal contacts
to people involved in such infrastructures. We thus think that the community of research
infrastructures will be engaged appropriately. One challenge will be to balance the disciplines
(Earth and Environmental Science, Life Sciences, High Energy Physics, Material Sciences,
Astronomy, etc.).
As holders of datasets resulting from operating instruments, data centers are another
community PIDINST WG should engage with. Of particular interest is the possibility to include
PIDs for instruments in metadata of published data as well as cross-linking, i.e. maintaining
explicit relations between PIDs for published data and PIDs for instruments. Such relationships
are also interesting to maintain provenance.
The PIDINST WG relates to various other RDA WGs or IGs, in particular Collections WG, Data
Type Registries WG, PID Kernel Information WG. Since compound instruments and their
components can be expressed by a collection of PID references, PIDINST WG naturally relates
to the Collections WG. As metadata of instruments should be described in an interoperable and
machine readable way, PIDINST WG also relates to the Data Type Registries WG. In some
cases, parts of the metadata might be of interest for fast decision processes inside workflows
overlooking a huge number of instruments. Such kind of metadata may be described as kernel
information inside the PID, which underscores the relationship to the PID Kernel Information
WG. Other RDA groups are relevant because they deal with hardware, including instruments.
An example is the Small Unmanned Aircraft SystemsÕ Data IG. PIDINST WG aims at engaging
other relevant RDA groups through joint sessions at Plenaries or participation in conference
calls, e.g. webinars.
Finally, it will be important for PIDINST WG to engage with international projects in the space of
persistent identification, such as the H2020 project FREYA; European infrastructure such as the
EOSC; as well as international infrastructures, especially those managing instrument
databases.
Adoption Plan
PIDINST WG aims at the adoption of its deliverables primarily in two communities: PID
infrastructure provider and institutional instrument database providers. Of these two, adoption
within the PID infrastructure provider community is the most important.
The white paper for PID infrastructure providers on persistent identification of instruments is the
primary PIDINST WG deliverable. PIDINST WG will actively engage the PID infrastructure
provider community in a continuous manner in order to communicate development and obtain
feedback. Ultimately PIDINST WG envisions that its results will serve as a base to implement
persistent identification of instruments in existing PID infrastructure. PIDINST WG aims at
avoiding building new infrastructure. Rather, the WG will suggest to build on existing ones.
The second most important community PIDINST WG aims at concrete adoption are institutional
instrument database providers. Their systems provide landing pages that describe concrete
instruments and are thus key in the resolution of the PID on the web. PIDINST WG not only
aims for such providers to adopt the instrument registration mechanism but also at
harmonization of the protocols through which human and computer agents can access detailed
metadata about instruments as well as harmonization of the presented metadata themselves.
Even though such aim is secondary for PIDINST WG, it is clear to the WG that harmonization
and support for content negotiation at this level is an interesting objective to keep in mind,
possibly for a future WG.
PIDINST WG also aims at adoption among instrument developers and manufacturers. The
possibility for such actors to register instruments Òat birthÓ is appealing. Adoption in this space
would provide valuable information on feasibility and implications to responsibilities and
workflows. Adoption among such actors is planned through active collaboration within the WG in
conference calls and physical meetings. While such adoption is interesting, PIDINST WG is
conscious of the limited time and scope, and will prioritize adoption in communities of primary
interest."
National PID Strategies WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/national-pid-strategies-wg,yes,"The existing RDA WGs and IGs linked to PIDs tend to focus on technical challenges, updates from specific PID providers on their activities and the state of the art, or on discipline-specific needs or challenges. The National PID Strategies WG would explore how PIDs form part of national policy implementation frameworks. There are systemic and network benefits from widespread and consistent PID adoption, and funders, government agencies, and national research communities have created PID consortia or policies (including mandates) in pursuit of these benefits.
At the RDA Plenary 17 a Birds of a Feather session examined six case studies of national PID strategies and frameworks, looked at commonalities and divergences between them, and assessed the potential benefit of collaboration and alignment in the development and implementation of future national initiatives.
The consensus from this BoF was that a National PID Strategies WG should be formed with the objective of mapping common activities across national agencies/efforts and reporting on the specific PIDs adopted in the context of national PID strategies.
Commonalities already exist across the example case studies, such as a national PID policy, a coordinating network/group developing roadmap and policies, similar PIDs being prioritised in national infrastructures and ORCID/DataCite consortia being common. These will form the basis for discussion within the WG and input from other countries will be sought.
The WG will enable coordination and community discussion to deliver the following:
? Coordinate and align different national PID strategies and bring together PID experts to support the group
? Mapping common activities across national agencies/efforts and a report on the specific PIDs adopted in the context of national PID strategies
? Agreed PID categories and defined common metadata and standards for PIDs
? A minimal set of PIDs for international interoperability
? Example ideas on governance and common workflows
? The benefits from having a national PID strategy and adopting priority PIDs and the investment requirements.
Having a WG looking at national PID strategies would provide an opportunity to promote international PID systems rather than isolated national systems, avoid replication of PID development, and exchange experience of national-level PID coordination and map needs.
Value Proposition
The value of PIDs and the underlying metadata associated with PIDs have been recognised across the globe. A number of countries have developed roadmaps, workflows and strategies to encourage integration and adoption of some of the key PIDs (priority PIDs in some countries) to support open access and open research. This WG will coordinate and align different national PID strategies and bring together PID experts to support the group. The work will be of interest to researchers, research managers, research information managers, research administrators, publishers, PID providers, funders, policy makers, repository managers and vendors, and institutions.
The WG will provide various ways for the community members to engage. Everyone who signs up to the group will receive regular updates through the RDA mailing list. These will encourage collaboration and participation in online discussions, group meetings, collaborative documents, etc. All documentation produced by the group will be publicly accessible and open for feedback.
Engagement with existing work in the area
The National PID Strategies WG emerged from the BoF session at the RDA Virtual Plenary 17. This highlighted case studies from the UK, Netherlands, Finland, Canada, Australia and South America (Brazil and Peru). This WG will bring together representatives from these countries who are currently working on developing and implementing national PID strategies. It also provides the opportunity to encourage contributions from other countries, although the outputs will benefit those countries who are yet, or are planning, to develop their own national strategies. The organisations represented from the above countries include Jisc, ARDC, Research Data Canada, CSC, and SURF. As part of our PID work we engage with organisations such as ORCID, DataCite, Crossref, ROR, British Library, UKRI, EOSC, FORCE11, STM Association, Knowledge Exchange (and others identified in the initial planning phase) and would encourage their participation in the WG.
This WG will be relevant to the existing Persistent Identifiers Interest Group (PID IG), where we have previously shared updates, but will be focused on specific challenges in the national context: multi-disciplinary, policy-driven PID engagement and integration, for example. As such, it will complement the PID IGÕs blend of project and provider updates and cross-PID community thematic discussions with an emphasis on specific implementation and coordination challenges.
Other RDA groups to coordinate with include Global Open Research Commons (GORC) IG, SHAring Rewards and Credit (SHARC) IG, PID IG, Persistent Identification of Instruments WG, FAIRsharing Registry: Connecting data policies, standards and databases RDA WG, RDA/WDS Scholarly Link Exchange (Scholix) WG, Research Funders and Stakeholders on Open Research and Data Management Policies and Practices IG, Data policy standardisation and implementation IG.
Engagement Plan
The National PID Strategies WG aims to engage with a number of parties, including PID providers, publishers, PID infrastructure providers, funding agencies, HE institutions and sector bodies.
The National PID Strategies WG plans to organise a WG session at each RDA Plenary during the WGÕs lifetime. ItÕs hoped that the first session will be the RDA Virtual Plenary 18 when itÕs likely that the WG status will be pending. The plenary sessions will be the main face-to-face meetings in which to provide updates, make decisions and discuss the actions over the six-months period. The WG will also present its progress in the RDA PID IG session at each plenary session, if accepted. Individuals may also utilise regular conferences to promote the group and encourage participation.
Work Plan
Deliverables
The National PID Strategies WG will first of all map common activities across national agencies/efforts and deliver a report on the specific PIDs adopted in the context of national PID strategies. It will seek community input to agree on PID categories and define common metadata and standards for PIDs, define a minimal set of PIDs for international interoperability, and provide example ideas on governance and common workflows. The report produced is a recommendation that can be adopted or adapted by other countries looking to develop their own national PID strategies. By following the recommendations it will encourage standardisation internationally.
Milestones
Assuming the WG is endorsed in time for the RDA Virtual Plenary 18, the WG will kick-off at this event. This will allow us to encourage participation in the WG and consensus on its core objectives. Each subsequent Plenary during the WGÕs lifetime (M1-M18) will be a milestone as we will provide updates on the WGÕs progress and review the plan.
0 - 6 months - map common activities across national agencies/efforts and deliver a guide on the specific PIDs adopted in the context of national PID strategies. This will help others, irrespective of geographical region, follow a blueprint to defining their national PID approach.
0-12 months - seek community input to agree on PID categories and define common metadata and standards for PIDs, define a minimal set of PIDs for international interoperability, and provide example ideas on governance and common workflows.
12-18 months - complete community consultation and finalise agreement on report, national case studies, PID categories, common metadata and standards for PIDs, and minimal set of PIDs.
Operation
The National PID Strategies WG will meet virtually or physically (depending on restrictions) at RDA Plenary meetings (P18, P19, P20 or P19, P20. P21 if not endorsed in time for P18) during its 18 months lifetime. These meetings will serve as a platform to present and discuss progress, address and resolve open issues, and to plan the following six-months phase.
The WG will also hold monthly calls for the whole group. These will allow the group members to check on progress against the plan, update the community and obtain input and feedback.
Consensus and Conflicts
The National PID Strategies WG plans to develop consensus by encouraging and ensuring participation in online monthly meetings, as well as the larger plenary meetings. Input will be provided by the initial six case studies, which will be used to define PID categories and define common metadata and standards for PIDs. Through community consultation it will ensure that the work is not restricted to these countries but is open to a wide and diverse group as possible.
If consensus cannot be reached the WG will vote on issues and adopt a weighted multi-vote approach whereby each member can cast up to three votes, from most to least preferred.
The co-chairs are committed to keep the development on track and within scope. We will also undertake regular retrospectives where we assess progress against milestones and review the plan for the next phase.
Community Engagement
The working group case statement will be disseminated to RDA mailing lists, relevant PID communities and stakeholders, PID providers, funders and publishers to ensure a diverse, international and multidisciplinary membership. As well as engaging via the RDA, there are other groups and events where the PID community come together. Members of this working group are active within these and well placed to ensure the activities of this working group are brought to the attention of an international community, as well as ensuring input into the working group comes from these multiple sources. Engagement will not just be focussed on the global north and we have already included strategies from South American countries, but we will ensure there is engagement and input from other countries from the global south and developing countries.
Group members are already involved in events such as PIDapalooza, sit on community steering groups for PID providers and engage with international PID-related work. We will work to ensure the membership of the group is increased to include as many members of the PID community as possible, as well as including those that may not yet have participated in such activities and groups. We will engage with EOSC, in particular the PID policy work to ensure the working groupÕs activities are aligned with the European PID landscape.
Adoption Plan
The primary deliverable from the working group is the report produced from converging multiple national PID strategies that can be adopted or adapted by other countries looking to develop their own national PID strategies. The working group will actively engage with PID providers, funders, publishers and relevant groups throughout the lifetime of the group in order to communicate progress and obtain feedback.
As well as encouraging countries to adopt national strategies for PIDs, part of the groupÕs work is to increase the adoption and use of priority PIDs. This group will identify commonalities between existing strategies and those PIDs identified as a priority, but these need to be adopted internationally. PIDs have a vital role to play in the transformation of the research communication system. However, the challenges of achieving consistent, reliable PID adoption, integration and coverage are substantial. By having a set of priority PIDs and implementing national strategies, other countries can target solutions to research challenges, and ensure that the potential benefits of PID usage can be delivered and demonstrated to the research sector. This will bring savings to the sector as identified by the recent cost-benefit analysis report from Jisc."
Data Usage Metrics WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/data-usage-metrics-wg,yes,"Research data is increasingly recognized as an important output of scholarly research, however, there are not yet standardized or comprehensive metrics for research data as there are for articles. Data Citations are necessary for the advancement of research data recognition, and initiatives in the RDA and scholarly communications space (eg. RDA/WDS Scholarly Link Exchange WG) are working to gain community adoption. Complementary to citations are data usage metrics (views, downloads). Both usage metrics and data citations are currently not yet counted and aggregated into clear metrics, as it is done for articles.

The ÒMake Data CountÓ project hosted a Birds of a Feather at RDA Plenary 10 (attended by 60 people) and recognized that many other groups are impacted by this initiative and there is widespread interest in implementing a standardized set of data usage metrics. Lending expertise from various projects and research stakeholders, this WG, a part of the Publishing Data IG, aims to harness community in-put and buy-in of data usage metrics and drive widespread adoption.
 
The WG intends to be international by design. The WG recognizes that for data usage metrics to be adopted at a global scale, representatives from all global regions need to help shape the WG outcomes. Therefore, the WG will actively recruit participants from all regions globally, including international initiatives (e.g.,. OpenAire, ANDS) and will be directing outreach globally through webinars, related conferences, and consistent communication. 

Value Proposition
Adoption of Data Usage metrics is necessary for the recognition of research data as a first-class research output. Researchers will benefit from data usage metrics by being able to see the value-add of opening up their work, funders will be able to track the impact of their funding, publishers will see the relation and usage of articles with the underlying data, and repositories will be able to better serve their research communities. 

Engagement with existing work in the area
This WG has members from the Make Data Count project, a Sloan grant between the California Digital Library, DataCite, and DataONE to build the technical infrastructure for data-level-metrics. For data usage metrics to work, the WG will need to leverage existing initiatives (CrossRef Event Data, DataCite) and work closely with RDA/WDS Scholarly Link Exchange WG. As part of the Publishing Data IG, the WG will work closely with the repository, publisher, and library communities to ensure data usage metrics have widespread community input and buy-in.

The WG plans to meet at each RDA for the next 18 months as well as web meetings monthly (when there is not an RDA Plenary). The WG will have consistent communication (via email listserv) throughout the 18 months with updates on deliverables as well as ongoing work in the data metrics space.

While there may be disagreements or difficulty building consensus in an area that does not yet have standards, the WG would be keen to involve as many members from the various communities involved in research data as possible (to illustrate the full landscape) and would work methodically to ensure the community is in agreement about each piece of the deliverables while considering different needs from different communities. Standards will be developed with community input and the recommendation will be put together to cover the broad range of usage metrics within the research data space. WG Plenary sessions would not be a presentation but rather a working meeting to use the time as a consensus building and feedback session to ensure deliverables are in line with community needs. 

The RDA community is large and diverse but this WG would look beyond the WG to ensure researchers (end users) are involved and supportive, and to to drive adoption to as many repositories and institutions as possible. Utilizing connections from WG members and displaying successful implementation in WG member repositories, the WG would be focused on mass adoption and community buy-in.


Adoption Plan 
Data usage metrics would be implemented within repository organizations that are involved in the WG and further pushed out to the larger repository community. Initially,  views and downloads data usage metrics will be implemented on the Dash platform (California Digital Library), DataONE repositories, and Mendeley Data (Elsevier) for early adoption. Further down the line, repositories will be able to identify with metrics types that are sufficient for their database type (i.e. CCDC, OpenAire, Springer) that are not solely looking at views and downloads. Implementation in these spaces will show the broad scope of ways to implement and documentation about each will aid with driving adoption of the data usage metrics conversation in the researcher and RDA communities. Institutions in the WG will be able to implement data usage metrics for institutional repositories and publishers will be able to display data usage metrics in relation to the corresponding article-level-metrics. Funders involved in the WG will be able to utilize these data usage metrics and push for grantees to be depositing in repositories with these metrics (and reporting back on them)."
Preserving Scientific Annotation WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/preserving-scientific-annotation-wg,yes,"The Preserving Scientific Annotation RDA Working Group (PSA-WG) will precipitate adoption of reliable standards-based preservation solutions for both newly-created research contributions which employ annotation of data and documents, and also those redelivered from existing research investments. Annotation of digital resources has emerged as a new research paradigm, extending across scientific domains and offering significant opportunities for improving discovery and preservation of research investment compared with existing workflows and conventional publication processes.

However, realizing long-term benefits from annotation methodologies has remained elusive, due to continuing evolution of both the instruments1 which create annotations and infrastructures to store them. This has prevented development and operation of stable annotation workflows, and poor awareness of preservation vulnerabilities has led to loss of research investment or the need for costly redelivery to overcome cyclic technology obsolescence. However, this situation can now be remedied, in particular through use of PID strategies2 for reliably connecting annotation lists, contributing scientists and digital resources in the long-term.
 
1.1 Multiple Annotation Techniques

Annotation of born-digital texts and datasets, as well as annotations on digitized physical and media objects, can be traced from the ideas of Vannevar Bush in the 1940s and demonstrations at the SRI Augmentation Laboratory3 founded by Douglas Englebart in the 1960s. Widespread use of Bill AtkinsonÕs HyperCard and its later development by Apple Computer in the late 1980s led to annotation applications linking digital media4, and with rapid uptake of the World Wide Web after 1990 these began using HTML. However, it wasn't until 2009 that accessible instruments for creation of application-independent 'stand-off' annotations (represented, for example, in XML) for digitized objects appeared, creating a new mode of research which has entered mainstream practice. New research infrastructures precipitated by developments such as the International Image Interoperability Framework5 (IIIF) in late 2011 and the emergence in 2012 of nascent standards for representing annotations in JSON and potentially other serializations, have significantly accelerated adoption of annotation in fields such as medical imaging and the social sciences and humanities. IIIF breaches 'silos' of digital resources previously confined by different, incompatible technologies and instead enables delivery of assets from multiple organizations into research workflows using a single consistent interface. Although initially a framework for image interchange, IIIF specifically promotes stand-off annotationÑpartly because of its close organizational links with the Web Annotation Data Model6 (WADM) editors. IIIF is expanding to address other media types and multiple projects are already using WADM for annotating 3D objects and time-based media such as movies7.

The stand-off style of annotation has advanced, in contrast to the alternative of 'embedding' annotations with digital assets, which requires integration of annotation data with the specific digital representation employed to describe the object. Modification of different digital media formats in this way, and subsequent versioning of assets is generally impractical: for example multiple annotations created by different contributors lead to scalability problems with methods to retrieve and maintain embedded annotations. A particular limitation of embedded annotation approaches is the inability to effectively annotate across multiple objects or distributed corpora, since they are necessarily tied to a particular location. This seriously limits the ability to use annotation to construct narratives or flows through data.

1.2 Working Group Focus

PSA-WG will focus initially on stand-off annotation which can be represented using the digital asset- independent WADM from W3C. It will not pursue preservation of embedded annotations except through conversion to stand-off. Although the WADM specification is not currently supported directly by most research instruments, those already in use do generate annotations represented in JSON using various versions of the predecessor to WADM, Open Annotation Data Model8 (OADM), and this can be converted into WADM. In addition, the need to transform such existing annotations as the WADM specification evolves is also recognized, and can be automated. Moreover, through WADM's incorporation of a linked data approach to classifying annotations, the groundwork has been established for effective re-use of such research. As a result, millions of OADM annotations have been generated since 2016 and there is currently an explosion in the volume of new annotations being created. These developments have provided some important components for infrastructures permitting long-term protection of research investment employing annotation. However other key building blocks, particularly discovery and persistent storage for annotation, remain to be addressed before effective solutions can be provided to guarantee the preservation of both annotations and the resources they target. Consequently, research investment that relies on annotation is currently vulnerable.

There are also stand-off annotation techniques and activities which PSA-WG will not address at this time. For example hypothes.is9 an open source project enabling annotation of web resources, which continues an approach advanced by Google before 2010 (Sidewiki10). hypothes.is addresses annotation of text on webpages, rather than elements of independent digital assetsÑfor example features depicted in digital images themselves, or on solid models or in movie framesÑand as soon as the webpage is altered the annotations are lost. Because they do not select targets on digital resources which can be maintained independently of the evolving internet environment we do not address this family of technologies here, although it could be an important future activity of the WG to do so. hypothes.is currently supports Google Chrome and has announced plans for a similar Firefox development. Separately, Apache Annotator 11, is an ASF Incubator project supporting ÔWeb annotation in Web browsers, Web publication readers, and the servers that serve themÕ, which has set out a broader roadmap of annotator.js-based projects and plugins.

1.3 Summary of Outcomes

Anticipated impacts of the WG are discussed in Section 2 and in Section 4 the deliverables are described. The task of the PSA-WG is to tackle preservation of annotation in a substantive manner and its anticipated outcomes can be summarized as follows:

    communicating vulnerabilities: a campaign to raise awareness of preservation risks and halt the continuing loss of investment in research which employs annotation

    overcoming roadblocks to creation of end-to-end solutions for preserving stand-off annotation: identifying essential but currently incomplete preservation mechanisms and precipitating the implementation of new functionality by repositories and annotation instruments to fill these vacua

    developing preservation use-cases in collaboration with partner organizations in multiple domains of research activity, which demonstrate exemplary strategies for preserving annotation and communicating these effectively to the broader community

    influencing on-going standards developments to ensure robust and efficient preservation solutions for the long term and delivering new benefits from stand-off annotation such as annotation store-based discovery services, which cannot be realized until preservation issues have been resolved 12   

    Short-term priorities will include, for example, PSA-WG working with ORCID to implement an Annotation Work Type marker for contributor attribution and working with CERN to implement a 13  Zenodo Annotation Collection data resource type. These activities will produce a core identifier schemeÑORCID/URN/Zenodo-DOIÑwhich will be evaluated in pilot projects and incorporated in a Technical Report within the planned 18-month activities of the WG. The WG will later pursue the preservation of relationships between annotations and the digital resources they target using multiple identifier schemes, but discussions originating at PIDapalooza 2019 have led to an ORCID/URN/ Zenodo-DOI implementation proposal which could be evaluated in pilot projects and subsequently delivered within the planned 18-month activities of the WG. The WG will later consider an instrument- agnostic OADM implementation guideline to promote display and maintenance of annotations multiple instruments and improve migration to WADM.

2. Value Proposition
 
2.1 Overcoming Roadblocks to Preservation of WADM Annotations

Stand-off scientific annotations using WADM are packaged as discrete digital entitiesÑresiding in databases, cloud services, etcÑimplicitly related to a file in a digital resource: the annotated asset. Annotations comprise 'bodies' of information associated with 'targets' defined on the assetÑthe latter remains unmodified. The target definition is stored in the annotation, and uses ÔselectorsÕ depending on the asset type to identify the feature which the annotation body refers to. For example a movie clip or just one frame can be defined by a 'time code' referred to the end of the leader and start of discrete exposed frames (the Ôin pointÕ), plus an Ôout pointÕ. Media types determine how such assets can be targetedÑa PDF produced by a scanner without embedded OCR canÕt be targeted with a text selector in the same way that a born-digital PDF or Word file might be. However, the frames of a movie or the page boundaries of a document containing a snippet of text nevertheless ÔanchorÕ annotations to the respective assets in one-way relationships constituted by Ôtarget selectorsÕ.

With stand-off annotation these relationships extend no further than the contents of the annotations themselves, and unless precautions are taken to insure that the digital assets which they target can be located in the long-term then they become vulnerable. Management of research data constituting annotations is subject to local IT infrastructure policies and invariably different to the policies and patterns of investment affecting sustainability of the various digital resources which they target. Consequently, any changes affecting either infrastructure which compromise unique identification of digital assets, using annotationsÕ targets selectors alone, renders investment in those annotations useless. This situation is complicated further by versioning and the existence of multiple representation formats for digital assets; for example images may be compressed using JPEG for internet use, compared with lossless representations produced at the point of digitization. Annotation target selectors will, in general, be valid for only one version of a digital asset file, even if variants have the same resolution, so vulnerabilities currently arise when certainty of identifying the correct asset file using only the information in an annotation target selector cannot be maintained over time.

Moreover, annotations created using one instrument cannot currently be presented using another, without conversion and potential loss of information.

Lastly, although evolving annotation standards make provision for identification of creating agenciesÑ whether directly by a researcher or indirectly by software algorithmÑnone of the existing annotation instruments yet support ascription mechanisms, such as ORCID contributor identifiers.

2.2 Benefits for the Research Community

In summary, PSA-WG will address principal roadblocks to preservation of WADM annotation through the following activities:

    evaluating and producing recommendations on the use of persistent identifiers for annotated resources, to ensure long-term resolvability of annotation targetsÑadditionally, to address evolving resources so that annotations continue to reference the correct version

    recommendations for the use of WADM (and OADM in the short term) so that annotation tools can interoperate and share annotations without conversion

    develop attribution and credit mechanisms to ensure that annotations can be properly treated as scholarly activityÑadditionally, to provide aggregation mechanisms so that scholarly contributions can be managed at effective levels of granularity

    Success with these developments would also enable the WG to contribute to formalizing Ôresearch activityÕ identification15, and contributing significantly to better discovery of research investment  employing annotation. Research activities could be connected definitively to Annotation 16
    Collections Ñthemselves comprising annotation lists containing both identifiers of the resource  targeted and institutional or original contributor identifiers. Such connectivity would allow contributors as well as annotated digital resources to be identified by research activities with fine granularity, as well as permitting automated verification of continued accessibility of digital resources in the long-term.

     

 
2.3 Key Impacts

The volume of existing research investment incorporating annotation which is vulnerable, and strategies for its protection are assessed in Section 2.4. However, it is evident that the lack of robust standards-based infrastructure for preservation of annotation, as of the date of this document, is the most pressing concern. Without this, the probability of saving historic investment and mitigating the significant costs of redelivering research which is currently in progress or being planned are low. The roadmap set out in Section 4 to deliver annotation preservation solutions to the research community within the 18-month program of PSA-WG is not unrealistic, since new technologies will not have to be developed: effective persistent identifier and long-term repository components have been in use for several years. To provide preservation infrastructures for annotation, these components have to be assembled into practical solutions, and this could be achieved by the WG through selection from available components, publication of recommendations and detailed use cases. However, effective communication of vulnerabilities as well as recommendations and development of early adoption projects in specific sectors of the research community will be a WG priority. Key impacts of these activities can be summarized as follows:

    sharp reduction of loss in research investment using annotation currently being planned, through effective communication of vulnerabilities to the research community

    overcoming roadblocks to creating workable solutions for long-term preservation of annotation using available technologies where possible

    creation and communication of guidelines and use cases leading to uptake of preservation solutions for annotation and improved rates of recovery of historic material at risk of loss

    elimination of cyclic costs of redelivery or loss of investment in the future arising from lack or failure of preservation strategies for annotation

    create new potential for FAIR digital resources incorporating annotation

15 e.g. https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/record/1972842, https://www.raid.org.au/, http://www.researchobject.org/ 16 see section 5.0 of W3C Recommendation 23 February 2017, https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/

 
 
2.4 Scale of Research Investment using Annotation

Stand-off annotation is already a mainstream mode of researchÑincreasingly, scholarly information is being made available as annotations and comments created as part of the discursive process, rather than via conventional publication. Many of the assertions so made are individually not significant enough to warrant publication unless combined with many others and rewritten to form an overarching narrative. This may not happen immediately, and annotations often remain the only instances of such contribution for long periods. However, in the long run, the information content of accumulated annotations often 17 constitutes a significant online resource. For example, Early Modern Letters Online is primarily a catalogue resource but contains over 50,000 comments made by historians and literary scholars that greatly enhances its utility.

Individual research endeavors organized around annotation are also multiplying, as standards for defining annotations emerge and new instruments for creating them precipitate innovative methods and inflect research agendas. This evolution is distributed across research domains, from the natural and life sciences to the social sciences and humanities. For example, one of the long-standing editors of the current WADM annotations standards group is based at Massachusetts General Hospital18; the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM19) group represents hundreds of institutions and medical equipment manufacturers, some of which are in the process of adopting WADM. HeidelbergÕs Excellence Cluster for Transcultural Studies20 produced less than 100,000 annotations between 2010 and 2015 across multiple projects, whereas a single contemporary research activity at Europa Institute Basel has already produced more than 900,000.

Annotation investment by the Heidelberg Cluster would have been lost in 2017 when personnel supporting itÕs software infrastructure were reassigned. Urgent data forensic work on several projects led to creation of Invenio repositories and IIIF services and redelivery of tens of thousands of complex annotations as OADM targeting these new resources. However, mechanisms to insure connection between annotations and these resources remain to be finalized. The current Europa Institute project has developed its own standards-based repository infrastructure to be able to guarantee long-term accessibility of its outputs. These are high cost activities, for which support through conventional applications for research funding would be unlikely.

3. Engagement with Existing Work and Adoption Plan

PSA-WG will engage with existing data preservation work and with the research community in three distinct activities. First it will work with identifier management authorities and repository services to develop identifier schemes for preservation of annotation data, including organizations developing Ôresearch activityÕ identification mechanisms (as already discussed in Section 2.2). Secondly, it will develop partnerships with multiple research communities to evaluate effective identifier schemes for the specific digital resources and annotation instruments which they employ, leading to publication of use-cases and recommendations. Thirdly, PSA-WG will also work with groups engaged in on-going development of standards relating to preservation of annotation, including:

    developers of instruments supporting display, maintenance and creation of annotation
    standards developers contributing both to convergence of existing usage of annotation standards and their future evolution

Additionally, PSA-WG will engage with RDA ESIP/RDA Earth, Space, and Environmental Sciences IG, RDA PID Kernel Information WG and W3C WADM early in its activities in order to consult over development of pilot projects, use-cases and standards.

 
 
3.1 Collaboration with Identifier Authority and Repository Organizations

Section 4 addresses outreach activity work-packages, and describes the WGÕs strategy of creating and testing a core identifier scheme for preservation of annotation as the basis for development of schemes tailored to the needs of specific research communities.

This approach builds on preliminary work after RDA Plenary-11 on preservation of annotation pilot projects conducted by The Bodleian Libraries, CERN Repositories Section and Data Futures LBG. These activities redelivered vulnerable research in the humanities employing complex annotation; transforming annotation in legacy formats into OADM targeting new IIIF digital resources. However they did not implement a persistent identification scheme to connect the annotations and targeted resources. Since RDA Plenary-12 PSA-WG has worked with Zenodo and ORCID, as summarized in Section 1.3, to implement support for annotation-based research activities, leading to implementation of an Annotation Work Type marker for contributor attribution and a Zenodo Annotation Collection data resource type.

In the first months of its work-plan after being formally established, PSA-WG will implement an ORCID/URN/Zenodo-DOI annotation identifier scheme for the previously redelivered humanities corpora and additionally implement this scheme in a new humanities research project (see WP2). However the WG recognizes that IIIF digital resources (and consistent implementation of URN) and the Mirador21-flavored OADM employed in these projects is not representative of preservation requirements of other research communities. PSA-WG will work with partners in the life and physical science communities (current discussions summarized in Section 3.2) who are already planning development of annotation workflows, in order to develop effective identifier schemes for those domains. This will require collaboration with multiple digital resource PID authorities, research activity developers, such as Research Object Consortium, and with repository services and developers. Accordingly, Bodleian, CERN and Data Futures will pursue discussions with a new tier of organizations, such as California Digital Library and Duraspace from Plenary-13 onwards.

 
 
3.2 Engagement with Research Activities in the Life and Physical Sciences

Multiple attendees of the PSA-WG Birds-of-a-Feather meeting at Plenary-12 expressed interest in developing preservation of annotation pilot projects in disciplines other than the humanities. As a result discussions are now in progress with the Earth sciences, bioinformatics and medical imaging communities. Preliminary evaluations using GeoTIFF and DICOM datasets were implemented in early 2019; correspondence between PSA-WG and ELIXIR led to a meeting at PIDapalooza and project meetings scheduled at Plenary-13; multiple internet meetings have led to ESIP joining PSA-WG and discussions are now scheduled at Plenary-13 to develop collaborative project roadmaps. Additionally, pilot projects in science and technology have commenced before Plenary-13 (see Section 5) and will deploy the same ORCID/URN/Zenodo-DOI annotation identifier scheme already developed in PSA- WG projects for Plenary-12Ñforming the first tier of adopters.

 
 
3.3 Input to Standards Activities

Preliminary PSA-WG partners The Bodleian Libraries, CERN Repositories Section and Data Futures LBG have been developing discussions with the standards activities of multiple communities including IIIF and W3CÕs WADM since 2017. The Bodleian Libraries was instrumental in establishment of IIIF and Data Futures was a founder member. CERN is a founding OpenAIRE partner. Separately, Data Futures established some of the first workflows employing IIIF-Mirador to be deployed in high volume, and has already worked with both community groups as well as WADM to resolve roadblocks and contribute to new functionality. Significantly, the Chair of IIIFÕs 3D Community Group has joined PSA-WG membership and has commenced a pilot annotation project using the WGÕs pilot infrastructure. The Chair of the Universal Viewer Community (UV) Group has joined PSA-WG, and preliminary discussions about display of existing annotations using UV and development of a roadmap for creation and maintenance of annotations in UV will continue after Plenary-13.

Early drafts of PSA-WGÕs Technical Report will be provided to the IIIF and WADM editors and also circulated to the Mirador and UV developers to precipitate consultation before publication. Separately, existing collaboration between PSA-WG and ORCID and Zenodo will continue, leading to development of preservation of annotation documentation for those platforms. Finally, it is expected that consultation with another tier of persistent identifier authorities and repository developers will lead to support for annotation work and data types mirroring what has already been achieved with ORCID and Zenodo through implementation of extensions to those technologies.

3.4 Plan for Adoption

Two phases of adoption of PSA-WG recommendations by the community are envisaged. It has been demonstrated that collaboration with mainstream identifier and repository organizations has already led to delivery of one robust identifier scheme for preservation of annotation in the humanities and science and technology communities. PSA-WG will commence by applying that scheme to historic research investment redelivered by the preliminary partners and then apply it to a new research activity. Following evaluation of these solutions the WG will support an already-identified first tier of early adopter research projects. Publication of use cases from these activities, together with the guidelines identified in WP1 and WP7 of the work-plan in Section 4, will provide an effective blueprint for preservation of annotation-based research data in both redelivery and new projects. Funding applications are also being developed for a second tier of projects by the PSA-WG implementation partners (see Section 5). It is envisaged that these two tiers of adoption will create sufficient critical mass to support an international conference on preservation of scientific annotation in the humanities and science and technology communities during the 12 months following the completion of the WG work-plan.

In a second phase of adoption the WG will work with its collaboration partners in the Earth sciences, bio-technology and medical imaging communities to establish a tier of adoption projects building on the pilot annotation use-cases in those communities. These projects cannot be identified at the outset, but there are clear strategic differences compared with the phase one adoption plan set out above. In the humanities and science and technology, research activities are more corpus-specific in comparison with the selected phase two communities, where relatively homogeneous data supports a multiplicity of research activities. For example data at a given level of detail might be produced by different sensors: tomography can represent a cross section through a human body using X-rays or ultrasound. This data can support a wide range of expert interpretation but all medical data is about the human body. PSA- WG collaboration partners such as ESIP and ELIXIR and DICOM users have broad constituencies and will enable the WG to develop annotation preservation solutions more generally than the corpus- specific workflows already encountered in the phase one communities.
 
4. Work Plan
4.1 Activities

The PSA-WG work plan is organized into work-packages (WPs) representing three activities:

    outreach to insure that the existence of data preservation vulnerabilities arising from incorporating stand-off annotation are comprehended by the research community; subsequently, effective communication of the Technical Report of PSA-WG as well as its use-case outputs will be central to success of the WGÑWP1 and WP7

    evaluating and selecting techniques and technologies to plug the gaps in current data preservation planning relating to annotation, and in so doing overcome roadblocks to creating workable end-to- end solutions for long-term preservation of annotationÑWP2, WP3, WP4 and WP6

    consultation with multiple research communities already employing a range of workflows for creating and maintaining annotation-based research data, in order to create effective preservation solutions which are tailored for those communities and encapsulate them in use-casesÑsuch pilot project activities with PSA-WG partners will occur in WP4 and WP5

These activities will require that PSA-WG produce multiple documents:

    annotation Guideline communicating preservation vulnerabilities, plus an Annotation Primer describing techniques and effective use of annotationÑinitially posted as a PDF document on the RDA website and subsequently conveyed via summary presentations and posters at key conferences

    a Technical Report will be produced and posted as a PDF document on the RDA website after evaluating preservation of annotation using the core implementation scheme (see below), and implementing pilot use-cases together with evaluation/reassessment

    Use-Case publications will serve two purposesÑfirstly in preliminary form as evaluations supporting the PSA Technical Report, and subsequently as Recommendations tailored for specific communities

PSA-WGÕs technical evaluation and selection activities are expected eventually to address multiple identifier implementation schemes, reflecting varying PID adoption and annotation instruments in use by different communities. However, the WG must initially be able to demonstrate concrete preservation solutions within specific fields, in order to articulate vulnerabilities and demonstrate credible remedies to the wider community. Accordingly the WG will first evaluate a ÔcoreÕ identifier scheme using already-accessible technical components. Discussions among the initial PSA-WG membership (see Section 6.) including CERN and ORCID between P12 and P13, have explored developing extensions of existing services to enable robust preservation of stand-off annotation to be available at the time of launch of the WG. Specifically, these include the creation of an Annotation WorkType by ORCID and the support of an Annotation Collection data resource type by Zenodo, which developments have now been confirmed to PTTP by those organizations. Together with identification of annotated digital resources using identifiers including URN, this provides PSA-WG with necessary and sufficient components for its core identifier scheme. The development and testing of these mechanisms in partnership with CERN and ORCID early in its timeline will enable PSA-WG to turn its focus rapidly towards development of pilot projects, leading to use cases and consultation with other stakeholders. Proceeding beyond the core identifier scheme through such consultation is addressed in Section 3.

A potential follow-on activity of PSA-WG which is under consideration is convergence of different instrument-dependent representations for annotation (including variants of OADM) which are currently in use, and which lead to lack of interoperability: annotations created using one instrument cannot be discovered, viewed or maintained using other instruments. Discussion with other stakeholders has commenced, with proposed development of a further Recommendation document to achieve this, but it is not addressed further here.

 
4.2 Work-Packages

In summary, PSA-WG work-packages will include the following communication and technical activities:

WP1: produce ÔAnnotation Preservation VulnerabilitiesÕ guideline

WP2: implement and evaluate ORCID/URN/Zenodo core identifier scheme using ÔTwingerÕ corpus22 (recently-commenced research project)

WP3 redeliver pre-WADM humanities research projects (Bodleian Libraries and Heidelberg University) using core identifier scheme;"
"FAIRsharing Registry: Connecting data policies, standards and databases RDA WG",https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/fairsharing-registry-connecting-data-policies-standards-databases.html,yes,"The product of this WG will be a searchable registry of reliable and linked information
about databases, content standards (as defined in section 2.2) and journal and
funder policies in the life sciences on which a variety of stakeholders can base their
decisions. Specifically, journals, researchers and funders will be able to recommend or
select mature and community endorsed databases and standards, and developers and
curators of repositories and content standards will be aware of the requirements they
need to meet to ensure their products are discoverable and well described so that they
can be used by researchers or recommended by journals and funders.
To ensure a manageable project size and delivery within the 18-month timeframe, the
WG will focus on the life sciences and leverage the existing BioSharing1 effort; the
principles and the registry, however, will be developed in a way that is extendable to
other areas of science. This use cases-driven WG is led and constituted by
prospective adopters as well as technical implementers, many of whom are also
leading and/or actively involved in other relevant RDA IGs and WGs, whose activities
this WG complements and with which this WG will work closely.
2. CHARTER
2.1. Deliverables and beneficiaries
This WG will (i) develop principles for linking information about databases, content
standards (as defined in section 2.2) and journal and funder policies in a sample area
of the life sciences, and (ii) deliver a curated and prototype registry to access and
cross-search the information, leveraging on BioSharing.
The result will help stakeholders to make informed decisions, for example:
? Journals on repositories that meet the requirements specified by their
guidelines, but also meet the necessary content standards.
? Researchers on which journals meet their funder requirements, which
repositories meet which journal standards; also on which standards meet their
specific needs for data management, and subsequently for data sharing (per
funders) and publication.
? Funders on which journals and repositories meet their policies; also to get an
understanding of the current landscape of community defined-standards and
databases to refine their recommendations, and for comparison and reference
purposes to identify gaps.
? Developers and curators of repositories and of content standards on which
exists, who can be reused or even extended to meet their specific needs for
data management, and subsequently for data sharing (per funders) and
publication; but also on the requirements they need to meet to ensure their
products are discoverable and well described so that they can be:

? evaluated and recommended by journals and funders in their policies;
? used by researchers to meet their funder policies and the policies of the
journals they wish to publish in.
? Librarians that support scholars to or themselves aim to:
? utilize data standards; and conform to journal, institutional, and funder
policies.
? develop and maintain institutional data and publication repositories.
2.2. Motivation and background
Several data management, sharing policies, and plans have emerged in the life
sciences in response to increased funding for data-intensive science such as highthroughput
approaches in genomics and functional genomics, large volumes of MRI
data, etc. As part of the worldwide growing movement for reproducible research, the
efforts of funding agencies and journal editors are converging to encourage awardees
and authors to provide the underlying data together with a description of that data and
the methods used to generate the data, providing such details in a standardized
manner and making it available (publicly or via controlled access) for reuse. In parallel,
a growing number of community-based groups are developing standards, including
content standards for both data and experimental metadata. Broadly divided into: (i)
reporting requirements (or checklists, outlining the minimal information content that
should be reported), (ii) terminologies (such as controlled vocabularies, thesauri,
ontologies), and (iii) formats (defining the representation and transmission formats or
syntaxes that facilitate the exchange of information). These content standards enable
data sets to be harmonized with regard to their structure, formatting, and annotation so
as to open their content to transparent interpretation and, in principle, enable them to
be reproduced, compared and/or integrated. Researchers, bioinformaticians, and
developers continue to participate in the development of standards-compliant
databases to support data sharing; there are similar trends in both the regulatory
arenae.g.2 and commercial sciencee.g.3,4 , which have invested heavily in resources to
integrate external information with internal data to enhance the decision-making
process.
As a consequence of this general mobilization to support reproducible research there
are more than a 1000 biology databases5, over 300 terminologies6,7, more than 100
reporting guidelines8,9, over 150 exchange formats, and a growing number of data
preservation, management, sharing policies and plans that could help in the
annotation, reporting and sharing of life science datasets.
2.3. The problem addressed, the gap filled
Funders and journals cannot anchor their guidance to solid ground. There is not
enough information to make informed decisions on which databases or content
standards should be recommended. Data sharing policies are unclear; a very common
RDA WG Ð Case Statement: The BioSharing Registry
4
and loose text is: ÒApplicants should make use of existing, recognised standards for
data collection and management, where these exist, and make data available through
existing community resources or databases where possibleÓ. But what constitutes a
recognised standard or acceptable community resource? The same issues exist in the
publishing world, but for a few examples where some journals are working to
implement much more detailed policiese.g. 10,11,12,13. Similarly, reviewers and editors
can't sufficiently check for compliance because of this nascent guidance. Finally, there
is a disconnect between those information or computer scientists creating and
implementing data standards and those that perform review.
Researchers, developers and curators lack support. Systems such as DMPTool14
certainly help to create a data management plan. Nevertheless, no guidance is given
on how to best navigate and select the various content standards and understand their
maturity, or find databases that implement them. The struggle researchers and those
supporting them (curators and developers) go through is evident. Examples of their
questions are: ÒAre there content standards for publishing and archiving metagenomics
and metatranscriptomics data? The data sharing policy of my funder recommends the
use of Ôestablished standardsÕ, but which ones are widely endorsed and applicable to
my wheat functional genomics data?Ó.
The absence of well described and cross-linked information about databases,
content standards and policies is glaring. This bewildering array of resources
cannot be easily discovered, let alone searched and monitored. There is no central site
online that comprehensively catalogues, registers, or federates information on these
resources; actively curates them, keeps their descriptors up-to-date, monitors their
maturity, provides versioning; and collects metrics of usage and level of endorsement.
Without consistent metadata describing and categorizing individual standards,
database, and policy (e.g., according to the different life science domains or data type)
it is very hard to identify the relevance of a resource, and even cross-link them.
RDA WG Ð Case Statement: The BioSharing Registry

3. VALUE PROPOSITION
The registry of curated and linked information about databases, content standards,
and journal and funder policies will be a searchable environment for the evolving
portfolio of these life science resources on which a variety of stakeholders can base
their decisions. It will also serve to educate and foster communication between
researchers, developers, funders, editors, librarians and other stakeholders. The
catalogue will ensure these life sciences resources are registered, informative,
discoverable and accessible, maximizing their adoption and use to assist the
virtuous data cycle, from generation to standardization through publication to
subsequent sharing and reuse.
3.1. Tangible impacts
The proposed project will improve information about the standards and the databases
(maturity, uptake, implementation); provide information to funders and journals about
what standards are the appropriate community norms, what databases implement
which standards or is appropriate for a certain data types, or where data is curated and
openly available (or access is regulated for e.g. ethical reasons) etc. Improving the
quality in lists of databases and standards will allow funder/journal policies to
encourage transparent information and recommendation of community norms.
Interlinking allows the project to close the loop: here are the databases and standards;
here are the policies that refer to them (or not). For example, when standards are
mature and appropriate standards-compliant systems become available these are
channeled to the appropriate stakeholder community, who in turn endorse (in policies)
or implement (in databases) them achieving wider harmonization of the data.
4. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND REUSE OF EXISTING WORK
4.1. Leveraging on an existing registry
Run by Susanna-Assunta SansoneÕs team at the University of Oxford and maintained
as a community resource in collaboration with journals and related portals15,16,17, the
RDA WG Ð Case Statement: The BioSharing Registry
6
BioSharing registry already offers: (i) several functionalities, (ii) extensive content,
(iii) a network of collaborators, and (iv) growing recognition by funders18,19 and
journals as a central effort to map the landscape of content standards in the life
sciences. Leveraging on this existing efforts will also ensure that the proposal is
actionable and implementable within the 18 months time frame of the WG. A brief
BioSharing history and scope, along with existing content and functionalities of the
registry are provided in this section.
Building on the Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical InvestigationsÕ
(MIBBI) portal8 that only listed reporting requirements (or checklists), BioSharing
started in 2009 as a blog to accompany a paper published in Science20 with a range of
representatives from US, UK and European funding agencies expressly to centralize
links to the data policies of major funders. Since its launch as a registry and catalog in
2011 BioSharing supersedes and includes MIBBI, and works to map the landscape of
community developed content standards in the life sciences (broadly covering
biological, natural and biomedical sciences). BioSharing's goal is to ensure standards
are informative and discoverable, monitoring their development, evolution and
integration; implementation and use in databases; and adoption in data policies by
funders and journals. Currently BioSharing lists over 500 content standards and over
600 databases (partly cross-linked and curated) in the life sciences, collected
manually and/or submitted by users. Terminologies are linked to BioPortal16, world's
most comprehensive repository of biomedical ontologies; a closer connection between
the two registries is work in progress that will contribute to the work proposed by this
WG. BioSharing works with the Oxford University Press (OUP), via its DATABASE and
NAR Database Issue journals, to collect harmonized descriptions of the databases,
following the guidelines21 co-developed by BioSharing and the International Society for
Biocuration22. Lastly, to ensure that one common record exists for each database in
the life sciences and that for these areas BioSharing is the reference system, a MoU
has been established with re3data23 and work is in progress to implement the
agreement.
BioSharing registries already provides core functionality to manage the content that
can be extended and adapted. These include: (i) search and filtering; (ii) submissions
forms to add new records; (iii) ÒclaimÓ functionality of existing records (to ensure
maintainer of standards and databases can keep their records updated); (iv) personÕs
profile (as maintainers of records) is associated to their ORCID profile; and (v)
visualization and views of content. Furthermore, BioSharing is becoming an important
component of the nascent ELIXIR24 infrastructure of resources and registries in the life
sciences; as part of this larger effort it will be progressively connected to an existing
registry of tools. Cross linking standards, databases and tools is the ultimate goal,
along with linking these to additional resources, such as scholarly profiling and tools to
create data management plans.
RDA WG Ð Case Statement: The BioSharing Registry
7
Lastly, WG members Jessica Tenenbaum, Susanna-Assunta Sansone, and Melissa
Haendel have already laid the basis to develop criteria to be used in evaluating
standards for adoption25. In conclusion, BioSharing offers a unique base, from the
content, functionalities and network of communityÕs view points, on which to build the
proposed registry.
4.2. Existing RDA IGs and WGs
Co-chairs and members of this WG are already involved in other approved or
proposed RDA IGs and WGs groups26 that are relevant or related to the registry,
including, but not limited to:
? Metadata Standards Directory WG
? which we relate to, with minimal overlap (that will be resolved by working
closely with this group) but extending on their scope because our WG will
provide (i) deep and granular focus on the life science domains and (ii)
the interlinking value of content standards with databases and policies.
? RDA/WDS Certification of Digital Repositories IG
? (proposed) Global Registry of Trusted Data Services IG and Data Fabric IG
? RDA/WDS Publishing Data IG and joint RDA/WDS WGs for Publishing Data
Workflows, Publishing Services and Bibliometrics
? RDA Dynamic Data Citation WG
? Several IGs in the life sciences, where content standards are also key, including
Elixir Bridging Force IG, Metabolomics, Toxicogenomics Interoperability,
Biodiversity Data Integration, Agricultural Data Interoperability, Marine Data
Harmonization etc.
4.3. Related groups and efforts outside RDA
Co-chairs and members of this WG have already collaborations and links with several
groups, currently operating outside the RDA umbrella, that are already part of the
BioSharing community15, or have relevant content or infrastructure the registry will
connect to, use directly or interoperate with. Beside the groups already represented
by the co-chairs and the core members (see section 7), others include, but are not
limited to:
? JISC-funded services such as Sherpa/Juliet27 for funder policies, BRISSKit28 for
biomedical research, projects such as PREPARDE29 (in particular the criteria
developed for a repository to be considered objectively trustworthy), and
JoRD30, which undertook a scoping study for a database of journal policies and
developed a draft schema for their representation.
? Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI)Õs eTRIKS31 project, also defining metrics for
selecting standards in biomedicine, that also include the Clinical Data
Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC)32.
RDA WG Ð Case Statement: The BioSharing Registry
8
? Pistoia Alliance4, a global, not-for-profit, precompetitive alliance of life science
companies, vendors, publishers, and academic groups that aims to lower
barriers to innovation by improving the content standards33 and interoperability
of R&D business processes; their initial discussions and needs have already
been documented34.
? Consortia Advancing Standards in Research Administration Information
(CASRAI)35, a non-profit standards development organization.
? ISNI36 International Authority (ISNI-IA), defining institutional identifiers.
? ORCID37 creating and maintaining a registry of unique researcher identifiers and
a transparent method of linking research activities and outputs to these
identifiers.
? re3data23, also via the MUO with BioSharing.
? International Society for Biocuration22 with whom BioSharing has already
developed guidelines for the description of databases.
? Open standards for scholarly profiling such as VIVO38.
? The DMPTool partner institutions, because connection with system that help
creating data management plans is critical for dissemination and uptake.
5. DEVELOPMENT PLAN
The proposal is actionable and implementable, and realistic within the 18 months time
frame, because (i) it leverages on the existing content and functionality of BioSharing,
which in turn (ii) is embedded in an ecosystem of complementary registries, such as
BioPortal, and those being connected via the ELIXIR infrastructure, such as a registry
for tools; and (iii) benefits from an extensively networked membership and an
operational team, committed to drive and carry out content and technical work required
to deliver a usable registry.
5.1. The workplan
The work and the tasks will be organized in Work Packages (WPs) and timelines are
outlined in the Gantt chart below.
? WP1: Community requirements, building and engagement
? Task 1: Collect use cases from adopters through interviews/focus groups
with stakeholders, e.g. publishers, funders, researchers, curators:
content coverage and top 10 key queries.
? Task 2: Ensure continued dissemination and feedback, using (but not
limited to) the existing network of the members and events outside RDA
plenaries.
? Task 3: Manage engagement and communication with relevant
communities (see section 4).
? WP2: Registry functionality
RDA WG Ð Case Statement: The BioSharing Registry
9
? Task 1: Review BioSharingÕs existing backend and frontend
functionalities (e.g. fields used to describe policies, content standards
and databases, but also type of queries that it enables), identifying
requirements based on outcome of WP1 Task 1.
? Task 2: Implement the identified modifications and additional
functionalities; test (and solicit feedback) iteratively against outcome of
WP1 Task 1.
? Task 3: Discuss and implement identifiers and versioning strategy for the
records, e.g. via DOIs and/or persistent URIs, also coordinating with
Force 1139.
? Task 4: Implement an Application Programming Interface (API) and Web
Service (WS) interface: so that the catalogue can be plugged into other,
third party applications as a resource.
? WP3: Registry content enrichment and curation
? Task 1: Define consistent metadata to describe and categorize individual
standards, databases and policies (e.g. according to the different life
science domains or data types).
? Write and publish it as an open document
? Task 2: Review BioSharingÕs existing content for policies, content
standards and databases, identify and adding missing content and
develop a strategy for content acquisition.
? The approach will be both pull, by active automatic harvesting
(federation) of information from existing resources, and push, by
encouraging submission of additional records from the community.
? Task 3: Implement global identifiers:
? Maintainers of records are already associated to their ORCID (as
a reward and accreditation mechanism to help drive new
contributions, giving a sense of ownership and enabling the
network effects of a community).
? FundRef40 IDs will be used to tag funders (of standards,
databases, but also as creators of policies).
? Implementation of group institutional identifiers, when these
become available
? Task 4: Assemble journal and funder policies regarding the use of
named standards and deposit in specific databases
? Review the existing content of Sherpa/Juliet, the schema outlined
by JoRD (a scoping study and business case rather than a
service), and any other available information sources or schema
that can be reused, leveraged etc.
RDA WG Ð Case Statement: The BioSharing Registry
10
? Task 5: Ensure all records are ÒclaimedÓ by maintainers (a functionality
that already exists in BioSharing)
? Contact and invite relevant groups/people to claim, update and
maintain relevant records
? Task 6: Cross-link the content by create relations among policies,
content standards and databases, via their relevance to specific life
science areas, technologies and data types.
? WP4: Metrics and recommendations
? Task 1: Using collected information, develop formal criteria to assess the
maturity of the standards, their usage in databases, standing in the
community and level of endorsement; work will be done closely ongoing
activities in ELIXIR, relevant RDA IGs and WGs , the Standards Group of
the NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) Initiative41, and others also
tackling repositories accreditation.
? Generate recommendations and co-use information, tagging the
records to drive queries and facilitate filtering of the results.
? Outline proposal for methods and tools that will be needed to
monitor the criteria.
? Task 2: Develop recommendations to standards-developing communities
to identify and version their files, e.g. technical specifications, suggesting
suitable places where these can also be stored and accessed.
? Task 3: Usability testing and iterative UI development (limited in scope
for initial prototype)
RDA WG Ð Case Statement: The BioSharing Registry
11
5.2. The short and long term goals
Within the 18 months life span, the WG will:
? Develop a registry prototype, leveraging the BioSharing system and content;
? Draft an operational plan for sustainability (growth and maintenance) of the
registry, e.g. as part of the ELIXIR infrastructure and the NIH BD2K, using EU
as well as national and international funding mechanisms.
As part of the long terms goals, the WG will:
? Seek official recognition of the output by RDA
? Propose to become an IG to ensure continued engagement with other IGs and
WGs.
? Continue to link the registry with additional resources in ELIXIR, e.g. a registry
of tools and a catalog of training material.
? Seek further integration with ORCID (e.g. records ÔclaimedÕ by maintainers of
databases and standards could also be visible on the personÕs ORCID page).
? Initiate integration with other open standards for scholarly profiling such as
VIVO and the DMPTool to create data management plans.
? Continue to investigate how best to monitor evolution and use of standards,
working closely with other relevant groups.
? How can start evolve efficiently and effectively if we do not know and
monitor who is using them? For example, if a terminology is used by a
group, but another wish to extend/change it, what are the downstream
effects of changing it?
? Monitor the adoption rate, outside the early endorsement by the core members.
6. OPERATIONAL AND ADOPTION PLAN
Months 0-12 will be dedicated to the user requirements and implementation phase.
Regular monthly virtual meetings will be held among co-chairs, members and the
operational team, using web meetings functionality. Bi-monthly virtual meetings, or
more often as required, will be held between the co-chairs and the operational team.
When possible, face-to-face meetings will be organized, particularly in conjunction with
existing and relevant conferences and events. The co-chairs will be responsible for
moderating the discussion and drive the development to meet the deliverables
according to the timelines (as in the Gantt chart), along with the operational team and
under the advice and guidance of the members. Conflicts and any time adjustment on
the timeline developments will be managed and addressed by the co-chairs, as
appropriate.
Within the 12-18 months we will initiate specific activities, geared towards the
dissemination and adoption phase. The specific plan for encouraging adoption will
include publications and presentations via RDA, CODATA, ELIXIR, NIH BD2K
RDA WG Ð Case Statement: The BioSharing Registry
12
meetings and those of other partners. Early endorsement by the core members will
also be used as adoption exemplars to other communities.
7. CORE MEMBERS AND INITIAL ADOPTERS
This group has a long-standing successful track record in collaborative community
development and/or service provision, a high level of background knowledge and
competence, but also the technical and social ability to engage with a large and
diverse set of collaborators and meet their needs in a timely fashion. Our unique
combination of experience and people will build a vibrant, interdisciplinary team to
drive, build, adopt and disseminate the resulting work."
GORC International Model WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/gorc-international-model-wg,yes,"The Global Open Research Commons (GORC) is an ambitious vision of a global set of
interoperable resources necessary to enable researchers to address societal grand
challenges including climate change, pandemics, and poverty. The realized vision of
GORC will provide frictionless access to all research artifacts including, but not limited
to: data, publications, software and compute resources; and metadata, vocabulary, and
identification services to everyone everywhere, at all times.
The GORC is being built by a set of national, pan-national and domain specific
organizations such as the European Open Science Cloud, the African Open Science
Platform, and the International Virtual Observatory Alliance. The GORC IG is working on
a set of deliverables to support coordination amongst these organizations, including a
roadmap for global alignment to help set priorities for Commons development and
integration. In support of the roadmap, this WG will generate a set of pertinent attributes to
identify common features across commons. We will not coordinate or certify the use of
specific attributes by research commons. Rather, we will review and identify attributes
or features currently implemented by a target set of GORC organizations and when
possible identify how they measure their user engagement with these features.
In the first case we will collect and curate a set of attributes that will allow Commons
developers to compare features across science clouds.
Page 1 of 18
The GORC IG has defined the Commons as ÒA global trusted ecosystem that provides
seamless access to high quality interoperable research outputs and services.Ó In short:
ÒDigital research resources for the common good.Ó This WG is motivated to identify
attributes or features that a user would expect to find in this system, especially those
attributes that lead to interoperability across different Commons infrastructures. In light
of that, in this context we define attributes: a standard, feature, functionality or point
of reference from which information can be documented, or measurements or
comparison may be made.
For example, we would consider attributes evidence or the existence of :
1. A well defined decision making process
2. A consistent and openly available data privacy policy
3. Federated Authentication and Authorization infrastructure
4. Community supported and well documented metadata standard(s)
5. A workflow for adding and maintaining PIDs for managed assets
6. A mechanism for utilizing vocabulary services
7. A process to inventory research artefacts and services
8. An Open Catalogue of these artefacts and services
9. A proven workflow to connect multiple different research artefact types (e.g.
data and publications; data and electronic laboratory notebooks; data and
related datasets)
10. A mechanism to capture provenance for research artefacts
11. Mechanisms for community engagement and input; an element or scale for
inclusion
The attributes listed above will be an initial starting point of what we would expect to
find in a mature research commons. The initial list will be augmented and refined by
members of the WG during a landscape level review of the target commons, as
described in section 5 below.
When relevant, the WG will collect information about how existing commons are
measuring success, adoption or use of their attributes and services within their
organization, such as number or amount of data downloads, contributed software, and
Page 2 of 18
similar key performance indicators (KPI) and access statistics. In our model, the
attributes will be the existence of a feature or service and are comparable across
organizations, although we will not be comparing the organizations themselves. The
KPIs are quantitative measures used within an organization to measure the uptake,
engagement or use of an attribute, feature or service. We seek to identify how
organizations are measuring engagement but do not seek to quantify or identify the
value of the KPIs in the Commons we review. Finally, while it is not the primary goal,
whenever possible we will collect information about exemplars of attributes or features
as we review the commons. This would include a finer level of detail about the
implementation or deployment of the attribute such as access protocols and encoding
standards.
For example, the attribute: ÒA mechanism for utilizing (or accessing) vocabulary servicesÓ
is exemplified by the existence of the NERC Vocabulary Server (NVS) in the EOSC, and by
Research Vocabularies Australia (RVA) in the Australian National Data Service (ANDS).
NERC uses the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) to represent concepts in
the vocabulary service and provides access via both SPARQL and SOAP endpoints. ANDS
RVA also serves SKOS-encoded vocabularies and provides a SPARQL endpoint, but also
a RESTful API and the option to bulk download complete vocabularies in a single file for
local processing. The attribute in this case is Òevidence of the ability to use a vocabulary
service,Ó satisfied by exemplars in both RVA and NVS. A relevant KPI that may be tracked
by ANDS could be Òthe number of download requests for complete vocabularies.Ó The
WG will collectively decide what constitutes an attribute, and will place a priority on
attributes that increase or enable cross domain and cross-commons interoperability.
For example, the ANDS RVA service also has the ability for users to self-register and
create, edit or upload vocabularies, a function not available in the NVS. In this case, the
WG will decide if the ability to create and edit, not just access, a vocabulary service
should constitute a separate attribute.
2. A Model, not a Certification
The WG will create and populate a model or framework to describe Commons
attributes, but we are not interested in endorsing, certifying or otherwise placing a value
Page 3 of 18
judgement on Commons and their features, nor do we intend this to be the only or
penultimate model of a Commons. The intent of the model is to provide an opportunity
for Commons developers to self assess their options for their roadmaps based on
attributes that exist or are desired by other Commons entities. We will collect
information about each of the attributes we see Òin the wildÓ, but the attributes are not
intended to be prescriptive regarding implementation, nor are they ranked. We would
like to state explicitly that not all commons-developing organisations are expected to
develop all these features; what they decide to implement will depend on their mission
and community requirements. The goal is for self identified commons that have
different histories and areas of focus to be able to use these attributes at their
discretion as they identify their development priorities. Organizations should be able to
add their own information about services and attributes that intersect with the model if
that is useful for them. We anticipate this will be an iterative process, especially at the
onset, and has been described by one of our members as the Òfruit salad approach.Ó
We recognize that Appendix A, where we have provided the target list of Commons that
we will review to extract attributes, contains a mix of research commons, organizations,
and specific national projects/initiatives. The list is intended as a starting point for the
search for attributes; the members of the WG have agreed to iteratively work through
this list in good faith and seek out attributes in support of global research services
interoperability. Our approach is to have an initial diversity of research infrastructure
types to help refine the focus to where it needs to be based on the group discussions.
There are additional organizations that some may feel belong in this target list, and we
have identified and included those organizations in the potential list of documents to
review in Appendix B. This reflects the WG's desire to narrow the scope of the project,
without removing relevant initiatives from the conversation entirely, especially those
that showcase cross disciplinary or cross domain interoperability. WG members will cull
through the list as part of the work plan described in section 5.
3. Value Proposition
This WG is motivated by the broader goal of openly sharing data and related services
across technologies, disciplines, and countries to address the grand challenges of
society. The deliverables of the WG itself will inform roadmaps for development of the
Page 4 of 18
infrastructure necessary to meet that goal, while engagements and relationships
formed during the work period will help forge strong partnerships across national,
regional and domain focused members which are crucial to its success. Identifying
observable and measurable attributes in pursuit of the global open science commons
will help create a tangible path for development and support strategic planning within
and across science commons infrastructures. In the future, best practices for commons
development will emerge based on the experience of what actions led to successful
outcomes. This work will provide a forum for discussion that will allow members to
identify the most important attributes and features and the minimal elements required
to guide their own development and build a commons that is globally interoperable.
Building interoperable commons will support many research efforts including work
focused on societal grand challenges and UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Finally, it will support developers as they seek resources to build the global commons by
helping them respond to funding agencies requirements for measurable deliverables.
The proposed WG was discussed at both the RDA 16 and RDA17 virtual plenaries.1
Participants discussed the initial work packages and agreed during the meeting this was
a worthy goal and the approach described in the Work Plan in section 5 below was
deemed appropriate.
4. Engagement with Existing Work
This WG will review all appropriate IG and WG outputs to determine intersection with
this work, and engage with the WG/IGs as appropriate. Some of the efforts are
reasonably well known now: the GORC IG builds on, and incorporates the previous
National Data Services IG, which was embarking on a similar exercise when the GORC
started; the Domain Repositories IG, specifically the repository-specific discovery
metrics. The RDA 9 functional requirements for data discovery will be very informative
of the attributes associated with data repositories and the WG on Data Usage Metrics
will inform KPIs for data services. FAIR plays an essential role for enabling seamless
1 P16 session notes and presentation; P17 session notes and presentation
Page 5 of 18
access to data and other digital objects, the RDA FAIR Data Maturity Model will be a
priority for the WG to review.
The Commons that will be investigated in this WG are likely either to have considered or
implemented outputs from other RDA groups, such as the Data Fabric IG, and the
Virtual Research Environment IG, just to name a few. These groups and many others
outside of RDA will have recommendations that speak to functionality and features of
various components of Commons; for example the EOSC FAIR WG and Sustainability
WG that seek to define the EOSC as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). We will review
these and other related outputs to see if they have identified attributes that we feel will
support our goals. This review period will ensure that we do not duplicate existing
efforts. Appendix B of this case statement identifies a few of these existing efforts, both
within and without RDA; this list will be expanded and reviewed by the WG members.
5. Work Plan
This WG is predominantly an extensive review of Commons and Commons-adjacent
white and peer-reviewed papers, conference proceedings, strategic and implementation
plans, guidelines and related literature, coupled with discussion and review by WG
members. Figure 1 shows the proposed workflow to be tested and refined by the group.
Page 6 of 18
Figure 1. Proposed workflow to be tested and refined by the GORC International Model WG.
Step 1: Identify target list of commons
Appendix A is the current target list of Commons as agreed upon by WG members at
the 17 July 2021 working meeting. This list represents a significant reduction in
Commons listed in the first 2 versions of this charter. The target 2 Commons reveal
representation in Europe, Africa, ME, Asia-Pacific and North America, with global
representation captured in the 2 domain commons.
Step 2: Define the form of the deliverable
This step begins by creating and identifying the most effective online collaboration
mechanism for the group. The overall goal is to create online spaces that allow
members to propose, refine and capture attributes, KPIs and implementations. As
part of this process the WG co-chairs have begun developing options for the group to
accept, tweak or reject as appropriate community building spaces. These include the
dedicated online RDA space, an online form for submitting attributes and generating
2
https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/global-open-research-commons-international-benchmarkingwg-
global-open-research-commons-ig
Page 7 of 18
slides used in WG discussions, a Zotero instance of references, a database to house
identified attributes, and an online collaborative document. We can also propose to
the group: a github structure, a wiki and commercial or opensource project
management systems such as Trello, Jira, Microsoft Project, MyCollab or
OpenProject. After the collaboration mechanism has been clarified we can begin to
refine the project deliverable.
We have identified two potential final forms of the deliverable for this working group.
One option would be to create an online narrative document that describes
attributes, KPIs and implementations, with extensive footnotes, hyperlinks and
references. This would be the easiest form to implement and has the advantage of
supporting easy asynchronous editing by WG members at their convenience. At a
minimum this group will create a narrative document that describes our process and
outcome.
In addition, we could create a relational database of attributes that holds information
about the source material used to review the Commons, along with their related KPIs
and implementations. Ideally these would be described using the same language
found in other parts of the commons, for example classified according to language
found in service catalogues like the e-infra catalogue standards and the GORC IG
Typology of Commons. Figure 2 shows an early draft of a UML that demonstrates the
concept of attributes as a database.
In addition to the form, the WG will need to decide what properties will be captured
in the description of each attribute, KPI and implementation. This will be the subject
of working group meetings in mid to late 2021. To the extent possible we will align
the classification of attributes with the topology of commons being developed by the
GORC IG.
Page 8 of 18
Figure 2. Draft UML for a database used to capture attributes.
Step 3: Generate Initial List of Attributes and KPIs
Page 9 of 18
In this step we will seed the database or document with an initial set of attributes
that WG members would expect to find in a research commons, similar to the
examples provided earlier in this case statement. This seed list will be based on the
expertise and experiences of WG members, and could be aided by existing
Commons service catalogues, such as the eInfra Service Catalogue standard. Service
catalogues and registries from mature commons will be very helpful in this WG, but
do not account for other non-digital features necessary to develop a commons, such
as the existence of an openly available data privacy policy.
Step 4: Create Sub/Task Groups
We anticipate that WG members will want to subdivide the group into task groups
according to their areas of expertise (networking, research data management),
domain (earth sciences, health and life sciences), geographic location (Asia-Pacific,
Africa), familiarity with particular Commons services and developers or by some
other subdivision of labor. As they see fit, WG will create task groups, each
responsible for reviewing a subset of the target list and ancillary documents.
There are multiple ways for the WG to create task groups. The WG will decide if they
would rather define the task group according to the deliverables, creating a
Commons Internal TG and a Commons External TG, or if they would rather subdivide
according to a typology of the commons, for example with some members looking at
pan-national, national, or domain specific commons,
Step 5: Literature Review/Collect and propose attributes
We have begun collecting relevant literature pulled from Appendix B and beyond in a
Zenodo library. WG members will self-select documentation from this collection to
extract information and propose attributes, KPIs implementations and report back to
the larger WG. This evaluation phase will include an examination of the outputs from
other RDA WGs and position papers available in the wider science infrastructure
community, along with experiences gathered by the WGÕs members.
Step 6: Discuss proposed attributes in WG. Approve or remove from inclusion.
Page 10 of 18
During each regular WG meeting, members will collectively discuss and ultimately
accept or reject proposed attributes. As part of their preparatory work for this project,
the Chairs of the WG will use the collaboration platform approved by the group in step
2. For example, the Chairs can create an online form that will allow members to submit
attributes, KPIs and implementations, which are captured in a spreadsheet and used to
automatically create a slide for each submission. Either the slides, or alternatively, the
growing, live document describing attributes can be collectively debated, edited and
wordsmithed during the calls. Once a submission is approved it will be incorporated
into the final product.
Step 7: Conduct outreach
Because attribute information may not be easily found in public documents, we will
conduct outreach to Commons representatives and related organizations to ask for
additional feedback and information about attributes used by their community. This
may include attributes, services or features already in use, as well as attributes that
organizations feel would be useful but which are not yet implemented.
Step 8: Create adoption plan in conjunction with IG and user consultation
In the final step the WG will synthesize the attributes, draft an adoption plan and
create the 2 deliverables described in section 6 below.
6. Deliverables
This group will create Supporting Outputs in furtherance of the goals of the GORC IG.
Specifically:
D1: a list of observable international attributes of features, services structures and
functionality that can help define a Commons and that will feed into a roadmap of
Commons interoperability. The attribute criteria needs to remain simple,
understandable and not skewed towards the particular reality of some of the commons
so as not to appear as irrelevant or unattainable to Commons developers. It will include
a description of implementations observed or planned in Commons examined in this
work. This will either be a narrative document or database and will include a
Page 11 of 18
non-redundant set of KPIs and success metrics currently utilized, planned or desired for
existing science commons, and classified by functional layers defined by the GORC IG;
how do we define a minimal interoperability. This is the primary output of the WG: an
organizational structure and framework that can capture observations of attributes, KPIs
and implementations currently in use or expected in research commons.
D2: Contributions to the GORC IG Roadmap for Commons integration. The contribution will
integrate the attributes into the GORC IG typology of commons, and relate any integration
or intersections with the CODATA GOSC work, including use cases. We recognize that RDA
working groups are expected to produce endorsable and adoptable ÒRecommendations.Ó In
this case, our recommendations will be captured in the larger IG roadmap document. We
felt that this body of work was sufficiently large to warrant a separate WG from the IG and
feel that it is appropriate for the IG document to be the vehicle for the recommendations as
it will lay out a plan for Commons integration globally.

8. Mode and Frequency of Operation
The WG will meet monthly over Zoom, at a time to be determined by the
membership, likely every 4 Thursday of the month at 13:00UTC. The WG will also
communicate asynchronously online using the mailing list functionality provided by
RDA and via shared online documents. If and when post-Covid international travel is
restored during the 18 month work period of this WG then we will propose and
schedule meetings during RDA plenaries and at other conferences where a sufficient
number of group members are in attendance.
9. Addressing Consensus and Conflicts
The WG will adhere to the stated RDA Code of Conduct and will work towards
consensus, which will be achieved primarily through mailing list discussions and online
Page 13 of 18
meetings, where opposing views will be openly discussed and debated amongst
members of the group. If consensus cannot be achieved in this manner, the group
co-chairs will make the final decision on how to proceed.
The co-chairs will keep the working group on track by reviewing progress relative to the
deliverables. Any new ideas about deliverables or work that the co-chairs deem to be
outside the scope of the WG defined here will be referred back to the GORC IG to
determine if a new WG should be formed.
10. Community Engagement
The working group case statement will be disseminated to RDA mailing lists and
communities of practice related to Commons development that are identified by the
GORC IG in an effort to cast a wide net and attract a diverse, multi-disciplinary
membership. The GORC International Model effort is also being facilitated by the RDA
Secretariat, providing a strong intersection with the EOSC community - this will provide
an additional level of community engagement. Similarly, the CODATA GOSC work, and
the associated coordination of both efforts by the Data Together group, will provide
additional engagement and outreach to the WDS and GO FAIR communities. When
appropriate, draft outputs will also be published to relevant stakeholders and mailing
lists to encourage broad community feedback, this will include both the GORC WG and
GORC IG membership. When appropriate we will ask members of the WG to reach out
to their own networks."
Working Group on Ethical and Legal best practices for Drone Data in a global research context (WELDD),https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/working-group-ethical-and-legal-best-practices-drone-data-global-research-context-weldd,yes,"This WG intends to develop two outputs: 

Outcome 1: A recommendation regarding legal and ethical best practice for the use of sUAS and sUAS data for research purposes including capturing, sharing and (re) use of data.

Outcome 2: A technical recommendation regarding the cyberinfrastructure requirements for supporting sUAS data capture in a research environment.

Value Proposition:

Based on 5 years of community engagement a number of relevant issues have been highlighted as potential topics for future work (the primary outcomes and context were published by the sUAS data IG in [1]). These were presented and discussed at P14 and following this community consultation process two outcomes were chosen as the primary goals the group wants to pursue:

    legal/ethical recommendation on sUAS research data capture, sharing and use;

    technical recommendations focussing on the infrastructure to enable sUAS research data.

These outcomes will specifically seek to address the needs of the following research communities.  

Outcome 1 is intended to guide researchers using and seeking to use sUAS to capture data, publish such data, and reuse the captured data.  Our engagement work thus far has shown this is a subject that has not been well addressed anywhere. Furthermore, as many countries are currently in the process of developing regulations regarding sUAS use, this is an opportunity to contribute to the discussions.

Outcome 2 is also intended to serve a range of users. As a new technology, researchers running and looking to run sUAS based data capture programs, and those who fund and support such researchers (cyberinfrastructure facilities, librarian, funders, and institutions) are currently lacking formal guidance regarding what cyberinfrastructure they might anticipate needing.  While many of these users are very capable of deriving such for themselves this is arguably unnecessary repetition. Our engagement work thus far has shown this is a subject that has also not been comprehensively addressed anywhere.

Engagement with existing work in the area:

As indicated, the above 2 foci are the result of a comprehensive global community engagement effort as published [1].  Throughout this work, the specific goal outcomes named have not been encountered.  Building upon existing research, therefore, the aim is to contribute with our recommendations to the ongoing discussions on the responsible use of sUAS worldwide in line with the shared RDA mission to develop and adopt infrastructure that promotes data-sharing and data-driven research in the field of sUAS.

To grow our network both within and outside the RDA, members are encouraged and supported to actively engage with a wide variety of interest groups and key stakeholders including policymakers. NGOÕs interest groups (independent) researchers and (non) commercial drone users to build a strong community and platform that will help us develop recommendations that have the best potential to be endorsed and adopted by the community.

In the case of Outcome 1, 

-    within the RDA, the RDA Legal Interoperability IG, International Indigenous Data Sovereignty IG, and Ethics and Social Aspects of Data IG have been contacted.  

-    External to the RDA are many potential points of input, the scale of our engagement will depend on our ability to scale our efforts. 

Of particular note are the subjects of legal frameworks under which sUAS operate in different countries, and the global and local norms regarding both human privacy and all sUAS observable objects in the world. With respect to regulations the International Civil Aviation Authority, along with specific WG members home aviation authorities are primary sources.  A third key source of information on this subject will be the growing number of institutional policy documents regarding the use of sUAS. Although research on responsible data management, exist providing a foundation for how institutions are addressing and considering local legal frameworks more insights are needed.  Depending on the expertise and interests amongst the WG members we for now propose to limit our focus at this stage to the US, the EU, Africa and Australia.

In the case of Outcome 2 which seeks to make recommendations regarding cyberinfrastructure for sUAS data, within RDA the range of groups that might be consulted is potentially broad given that sUAS can potentially capture data from nearly every domain and that the data pipeline touches on nearly every domain of data expertise.  External to RDA, the OGC UXS WG, ASPRS, as well as any national cyberinfrastructure research programs and all sUAS users all potentially would have value to contribute.  Clearly such a breadth of communities and commentators cannot all be consulted and a strategy of narrowing this breadth is essential. Specifically, the first task of the WG should be to seek out key representatives that are likely to serve as primary sources for the type of information we are seeking.  For instance, our group itself represents a breadth of sUAS users and programs, and the majority of us are connected to our own national equally experienced colleagues.   

Work Plan:

As the 2 outcomes of this work are largely independent of one another the investigative efforts can be run in parallel.  However, where work required involves consulting with common 3rd parties these parallel efforts will benefit each other by providing a multiplier effect in multiplying the number of potential input sources for each other.  In all work, sources, results, and discussions will be publicly recorded and available for comment in a RDA sUAS WG Github repository. Therefore, 4 stages of parallel by synchronised work are planned.

Stage1 Design (4 months):  In parallel and with each led by a co-chair, subtask teams will work to collect a list of  potentially relevant sources of information. Where these sources are people and institutions these will be noted but not yet consulted, where these are documents or otherwise non-human sources they will be reviewed, and summaries publicly recorded. 

Stage2 Information gathering (10 months):

Stage3 Synthesis and Reporting (4 months):

Stage4 Publication and Adoption efforts (2 months):

Adoption Plan:

From the first stage onwards, all WG members and especially co-chairs and core members of both subteams of the WG are expected to actively engage with various community groups involved in the sUAS ecosystem (experts, researchers, practitioners and decisionmakers)  internationally to raise awareness of the WG and create a platform for feedback and adoption of the outcomes. During each Plenary a working session is proposed and/or a face to face meeting to present the ongoing efforts regarding awareness, networking and potential for adoption"
Brokering Framework Working Group,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/brokering-framework-working-group.html,yes,"Mediation and Brokering
In a SOA framework, software components interoperability is implemented by defining and using common protocols. In a web services framework, interoperability protocols  are characterized by their interface methods, and bindings as well as their payload content. For example, in the case of protocols for data discovery and access, the payload content contains data and metadata encoded using specific models.    

Mediation and adaptation modules are often used to map two different content models or two different interface methods or two different binding types. Commonly, a mediation module addresses the mediation of one feature characterizing two different protocols -e.g. the payload content model.  

Brokering services can be used to implement more advanced and general mediation functionalities. Brokering components address all the three protocol heterogeneities: methods, bindings, and payload content models. In addition, they implement mediation from many-to-many different protocols  

In the geospatial information domain,  Brokering services were successfully introduced to mediate across the different disciplines/Community protocols for data discovery, access, transformation and (in the most advanced cases) processing.     

Problem Description
The scope of the WG covers data sources from research and scholarly communication. Within this domain obstacles for wider application of brokering techniques are:

1.	Multiple service protocols for data discovery, access, and application or processing;
2.	Multiple content standards for data and metadata, augmented by Community profiles and non-standard implementations;
3.	Multiple vocabularies and ontologies.
4.	Multiple adaptation and mediation modules that are not guaranteed to be compatible.

Research projects and research data infrastructure initiatives often solve problems associated with this diversity as a matter of course, but the knowledge gained and components developed during such a process are not visible and useful to others. Furthermore, project life cycle limitations lead to lack of sustainability, loss of expertise, code, and infrastructure.

Address the Need
?	Define a description schema for services, vocabularies, ontologies, content standards, and adaptation components based on current community research and operational developments that allow services and clients to be more effectively interfaced with mediation components; leverage prototype registries developed through RDA and other activities based on the above.

?	Describe a collection of existing mediation and adaptation components that can interoperate through well-defined existing interface specifications and applicable standards.

?	Create a mediation and adaptation components registry -the objective is to support implementation of a more general and agnostic mediation capability. This registry outcome may be integrated into DTR and other registry activities in RDA once its characteristics are defined and tested. 

?	Define a test bed environment for testing interoperability of mediation alternatives leading to recommendations for application areas. The focus will be on metadata and data mediation across data systems that address different disciplines and scopes. 

Mediation functions to be assessed by the test bed:

1.	Data discovery and access protocols including harvesting and synchronous distribution (subscription/notification).
2.	Data and metadata content transformation (harmonisation).
3.	Metadata content enhancement and Linked Open Data enablement through vocabularies and ontologies.
4.	Application to popular protocols and service definitions.
Support of RDA Working Group Outcomes
RDA Working Group Outcome	Brokering Framework WG Alignment
New data standards or harmonization of existing standards. 	New standard(s) will likely be needed to describe a component within the typical research data infrastructure in a standardised manner. This ensures that its capabilities and role within the architecture is clear and unambiguous.
Increased data sharing, exchange, interoperability, usability and re-usability. 	Interoperability automation is strongly dependent on the availability of brokering and mediation components, and on its automated discovery and invocation. 
Increased discoverability of research data sets. 	Brokering exposes data catalogues that are not completely standardised and thereby increases the scope of discovery.
Better management, stewardship, and preservation of research data. 	No direct contribution.

WG Charter
The workgroup has the following vision and mission:
Vision
 ÒTo define, develop, test, and implement a Brokering Framework that allows publication, discovery, and invocation of mediation and adaptation components in a standardised manner.Ó
Mission
1.	Community consensus on the way in which mediation and brokering components are described and invoked, based on real use cases Ð ÒBrokering FrameworkÓ Ð leading to a formal way for description and invocation.. The formalisation of a standard in this area is an external process and may involve participants in the working group, but is not a task for the working group;
2.	Demonstrating the value of the framework by developing, testing, and commissioning a reference implementation of a mediation registry.
Membership
Membership is open to any participant in RDA, and will include at least the initial membership (see below).  Broad experience and geographic participation will be encouraged. Organizations such as WDS with broad geographic and organizational representation will be invited to participate. 

Methods
The working group will make use of the following methods:

1.	Contributions from members in respect of current working components and use cases, through regular working group meetings. Such meetings will be held every 2 months and, where possible, aligned with RDA Plenary Meetings.
2.	In-kind development contributions. Provisionally, this will include work to be done by CNR and DIRISA. Other in-kind contributions can come from GEOSS, PANGAEA and possibly OpenAire.
3.	Leveraging and collaborating in developments and outcomes of RDA working groups in areas of registries, metadata, data fabric and others.
Value Proposition
A Common Architecture [3]
The generalized scientific data use case is usually implemented as one or more components of a Research Data Infrastructure (RDI), and does so within a particular architectural pattern. This is so because many of the existing protocols, standards, and specifications for a Global Research Data Infrastructure have been developed with a specific architecture in mind. 

This pattern can generally be described as a service-oriented ÔPublish, Find, and BindÕ architecture [4]. In such an architecture, owners and creators of data and data services have the obligation to publish it, but the obligation is on the end user or system to find the data that is required, and to ÔbindÕ it to a particular end use Ð whether this is visual inspection, download, online processing, or analytics.

 

Within the ÔPublish, Find, and BindÕ architecture, there are a number of components and resources that are critical, and some that are optional. It is critical, for example, that published data exists, is described in such a way that it can be discovered, and that some form of access is provided Ð even if the access is manual and by way of personal request. And, it is non-negotiable that the data, once applied, be cited properly.

Other aspects, such as proper curation, and the ability to automate tasks such as visualization, exploration, analysis, and processing, are optional.

Lastly, there are two kinds of brokering to consider in the generalised architecture. Implementation success in this architecture is strongly dependent on standardisation of interfaces for publication, finding, and binding. In practice, complete standardisation is unlikely to ever be achieved particularly across diverse disciplines, and hence brokering is required to modify variations of a standard or non-standard data, metadata, and application elements. In general, brokering describes adjustments in the service syntax, while adjustment to semantics and schema or content is called mediation. These are both considered in the development and outcomes of this working group.

It is possible to conceive that with assistance of brokering, end users will have a choice of more or less equivalent data services, discovery channels, and functionally equivalent applications. In such a scenario, the ability to assess the resource for usability and quality, metrics in respect of cost (if any) and service duration or latency could become increasingly important. A second type of brokering, based on a variety of metrics and aimed at optimization of online, automated processing, is a logical future use case.

Hence, from a theoretical perspective, it is evident that brokering and mediation have an important role to play in this commonly adopted architecture.
Evidence of Need
This need was identified in the GRDI 2020 project, and the final report [1] confirms the significant role that brokering and mediation is expected to play in future:

ÒThe ultimate aim should be the definition and implementation of an integrated mediation framework capable of providing the means to handle and resolve all kinds of heterogeneities and inconsistencies that might hamper the effective usage of the resources of a global scientific data infrastructure information infrastructure [2]. We envision that one of the most important features of the future scientific data infrastructures will be the mediation software.Ó

and

ÒWe, thus, envisage that one of the most important features of future disciplinary data infrastructures will be the efficient implementation of a set of boundary objects defined by the members of the disciplines being supported.Ó

In this context, the Ôboundary objectsÕ are equivalent to brokering and mediation components [5].

This last statement touches on an important aspect to consider: that any brokering and mediation framework should include the means for the community to easily share their brokering and mediation expertise Ð this is the only way in which a scalable solution can be achieved.
Practical Outcomes
The outputs from the Brokering Framework Working Group should include:

1.	Confirmation of the elements of a brokering framework: component description standard, registry specifications
2.	A community consensus, achieved via RDA working group efforts, to develop and publish a brokering and mediation component description standard that can be used as the basis of a registry of such components.
3.	Community consensus on the capabilities (service methods) of a registry: allowing discovery and description of a brokering and mediation component. This work is best done in collaboration with other RDA working groups, leveraging existing initial contacts through the Broker Interest Group over the last year.
4.	A shortlist of important components that are currently operational will be obtained with community assistance, and populated in the registry. 
5.	Testing the registry in the context of real-life applications: DIRISA  will be implementing a registry that can be duplicated as part of a test bed for the Brokering Framework Working Group.
Existing Work
ESSI Lab (CNR) and collaborators [6] have done considerable work to develop brokering approaches for GEO (GEOSS Broker) within the EuroGEOSS project. The value of the EuroGEOSS brokering approach has been demonstrated in extending the data resources available through the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) from a few hundred to over 28 million in a matter of 3 months. Brokering offers therefore a real chance to facilitate truly multi-disciplinary big data science and address the scientific challenges of our time. This work has since been formalized in the GI-CAT [7] suite of applications, and the Brokering Framework Working Group will aim to incorporate the brokering components into the registry. GI-CAT is currently in use by GEO, EU-BON, GMOS, ACADIS, PANGAEA, SeaDataNet, and others. Specific work has also been done to map CERIF to INSPIRE that can serve as an example of detailed brokering and mediation [14].

EarthCube [8] has developed the BCUBE component for brokering, based on GI-CAT, and focuses on the domains of Hydrology, Oceanography, Cryosphere and Climate. As such, EarthCube collaboration will contribute detailed brokering examples and use cases.

Within the EU, there are two initiatives that currently provide brokering services to a wider research community: OpenAire [9] and EUDAT [10]. 
OpenAIRE has built up a software framework collecting metainformation from from numerous content providers.  Guidelines supplied for content providers are widely adopted and include recommendations on export models (formats and semantics) for scholarly communication data sources. The framework comprises:
?	D-NET Software Toolkit (useful for development of WG prototypes): production-ready technology that implements the Òbrokering and mediationÓ patterns (registry of resources, discovery of resources, workflow creation, scheduling and automated execution, and customization of resource types)
?	http://www.d-net.research-infrastructures.eu
DLI-Service 
?	Models and format for exchanging data-publication links
?	Prototype (soon production) service: 
?	http://dliservice.research-infrastructures.eu

EUDAT has elaborated a number of infrastructural tools among them a  metadata discovery service - B2Find [18] - which is used to  harvest metadata from research data collections from EUDAT data centres and other repositories. EUDAT is open to collaboration and will be approached to participate formally in the working group.

DataOne [11] includes support for ILTER, and as such brokers a variety of global data providers already. DataOne is a collaborator in the EUBON project [16], and as such, either of these two initiatives will be able to contribute a significant body of knowledge to the brokering registry.

PANGAEA has set up a brokering framework Ð PanFMP [19] - applicable to earth and environmental sciences [17]. The framework is used since 2007 for the ICSU World Data System (WDS) data portal [20] and for various community portals, e.g. more recently for the German Federation for Biological Data (GFBio) data portal [21]. The framework can be combined with other frameworks like the GI-CAT or GeoNetwork [22].

SAEON [12] has developed brokering capabilities for a number of popular protocols and meta-data schema and map these onto extended DataCite meta-data schema for internal indexing and DOI registration. These components will be made available via the new DIRISA project. 

While the existing work described above focuses on brokering developments, there have been a number of RDA outcomes in the areas of registries, metadata, etc that will play a role in the creation of brokering component registries.  There are also application areas such as wheat interoperability that have discipline focused solutions which will be invited to participate in populating the test bed environment.  Use cases in programs such as EarthCube and ENVRI plus will be examined for appropriateness in the context of the test environment.
Work Plan
1.	Confirm use cases and examples of brokering mediation, with a view to classifying them and developing a data model for description of components.
2.	Develop content and service standards for a registry of brokering and mediation components.
3.	Create and populate a registry of mediation options that allow components to be shared and improved. Wherever possible, this could be based of contructs for existing RDA outcomes.
4.	Create a test environment to examine existing and future capabilities.
5.	Test and evaluate.
6.	Consider governance of the registry and the test environment in collaboration with the Brokering and other RDA Interest/Working Groups.

RDA/CODATA Summer Schools in Data Science and Cloud Computing in the Developing World WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rdacodata-summer-schools-data-science-and-cloud-computing-developing-world.html,yes,"The goal of the WG is to set up the framework to run a series of Summer Schools in Data Science and data sharing in low and middle income countries (LMICs). The series will run at a variety of locations but will have a base in a specific LMIC and the UK. This series would be endorsed by both the RDA and CODATA and would make use of the wide variety of expertise within these organisations. 

In the 18 month period of the WG it will
¥	Determine the best curriculum for the school in collaboration with others.
¥	Organise partnerships with LMIC institutions.
¥	Arrange how the materials can also be delivered online.


Value Proposition
Research in LMICs is hampered by a variety of infrastructural issues. Access to research data in the public domain and the computational resources to analyse them, would give researchers in LMICs the chance to do world-class research that is relevant to their society. In order for this to happen, researchers need to understand the techniques of Data Science and the importance of the principles of data sharing. 

Students for the school will be either postgraduate students or lecturing staff at universities and will be selected by the hosting institutions. Such students will be in an ideal position to implement their own research programmes and will disseminate what theyÕve learnt to a larger cohort. In this way over a comparatively short period of time the level of understanding of this field can be built up and impact research. The creation of a cadre of individuals who can analyse, maintain and curate data sets will be an important skill which will also positively impact the local society as enterprises based on data analysis will expand.

Engagement with existing work in the area: 
There exist a number of initiatives that provide training in these fields; for example there are a number of Summer Schools in Europe on cloud computing (see attached document of links). Microsoft Research provide training sessions on their cloud Azure.  There are now two MOOCs in Data Science and the number of masterÕs programmes in this area is expanding rapidly. Analysis platforms such as R have an ever-expanding set of teaching resources. The Software Carpentry movement, which has many of the correct pedagogical approaches for this school has events across the developed world (and has had sessions in South Africa). AidData have provided training in the analysis of social data in the developing world. The Wellcome Trust has provided funding for a successful series of schools in Bioinformatics in the Developing World. The Accelerated Data Programme of the International Household Panel Survey, and the IHPS in general provide tools and training to many developing country institutions, to increase the availability and quality of survey data.

CODATA has longstanding activities to build capacity in countries with developing and emerging economies.  The most recent include:
¥	The PASTD Task Group (Preservation of and Access to Scientific and Technical Data in/for/with Developing Countries) has run a series of workshops in developing countries.  The last was in Nairobi, Kenya in August 2014.  Target countries for similar workshops over the next two years are likely to be Malaysia or Indonesia and Brazil.
¥	CODATA China, with support from the Chinese Academy of Science, ran a training workshop in Big Data for Science for Researchers from Countries with Developing and Emerging Economies.
¥	SciDataCon 2014, International Conference on Data Sharing and Integration for Global Sustainability, is taking place in New Delhi, India, in November 2014 and features a number of sessions and workshops on related issues.
We have already made contacts with a variety of the above different organisations. CODATA is very happy to participate and to be a co-sponsor of the group.  AidData has expressed an interest in the proposal. Within the RDA there is the new IG in Education and training on handling of research data..  This new IG  can provide guidance on what the curriculum should be. The Wellcome Trust has expressed a willingness to provide guidance based on their experience.

Adoption Plan:
Final Deliverables :- 
1.	Agreements from relevant partners to provide technical support for online materials. This will involve a breakdown of what the online materials will provide, the level of support that needs to be provided to develop and maintain these resources. 
2.	Agreements from institutions willing to run the school. Each agreement will be an MoU that the institution will host and provide the logistical resources to make the school happen. As outlined in the timeline below, this will be completed between the 5th and 6th RDA plenaries. On the basis of the first two agreements the RDA council and CODATA will be called upon to endorse the proposal.   
3.	The outline for a typical Summer School. This will include a breakdown of the curriculum, methods of assessment, requirements in terms of technical resources and the organization of lectures and labs. The IG on Education and Training on handling of research data and other parties listed above, with whom this WG will liaise with, will be able to provide a detailed breakdown of what that curriculum should be. As it is, each school will be based on the distinct themes that have been observed in Data Science, e.g. computing resources, analysis and data sharing which themselves are composed of different sub-themes; for example the data sharing theme would have data storage and annotation  sub-theme and an accessibility (making own data available and accessing outsidethers data) sub-theme; the analysis theme would have a statistical/machine learning sub theme and a visualization sub theme and so on.  Each school would focus on a specific theme but also give an introduction to the other themes. Each school would, in addition, also have a specific domain where this is applied to give a context to the topic and hence demonstrate to the students how this could be applied, for example describing appropriate data sets for the discipline and how to access them..  As a result, graduates of the school would have an understanding of the bigger picture that Data Science provides while being able to apply them readily to their area of research. In addition to this, other options will be considered to improve the sustainability of the initiative, in particular joint PhD programmes for students who have taken part in the school and the possibility of accreditation for individual who specialises in the field on a longer term basis.

The timeline for this is as follows :- 
 


Intermediate documents.
The documents for this WG are as follows:
1 Initial document to RDA TAB on organization and running of WG 
2 Template agreement with online delivery partners.
3 Template MoU with hosting institution.
4 Draft endorsements from RDA and CODATA.
5 Draft proposal.
6 Curriculum for schools, including learning outcomes and forms of assessment.

Operation
An initial document on the WG will be sent to the RDA TAB on the WGÕs organization and basic running. An email list of the WG members will be set up and all emails will be based on this. WG meetings will be based on monthly conference calls, using the RDA service provided, which will review progress using the above Gantt diagram. Significant disagreements between members will be dealt with by the co-chairs. The co-chairs will meet and discuss on a more regular (fortnightly) basis. In order to achieve consensus or resolve conflicts, the WG will consult with the RDA TAB and the IG on Education and Training on handling of research data.  

The WG will reach out to the parties mentioned above and liaise with a number of discipline specific IGÕs and WGÕs within the RDA including the Wheat Data Interoperability WG, Agricultural Data Interoperability IG, Big Data Analytics IG, Biodiversity Data Integration IG, Digital Practices in History and Ethnography IG, Geospatial IG, Marine Data Harmonisation IG, RDA/CODATA Materials IG, Infrastructure and Interoperability IG, Research data needs of the Photon and Neutron Community IG, Structural Biology IG, Data for development IG  and Toxicogenomics Interoperability IG by contacting directly their chairs and asking for the opinion and feedback on the WGÕs goals. 

As the school goes forward the organizers will organize a panel to advise on how to update the teaching material on an annual basis on this rapidly evolving topic."
CoreTrustSeal Maintenance WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/coretrustseal-maintenance-wg,no,"To ensure the quality and usability of shared data, the long-term preservation of these data in sustainable digital repositories is a sine qua non. Data that are created and used by science and scholarship need to be managed, curated, and archived so that the substantial investments in preparing and presenting the content and tools will not be lost. Certification is fundamental in guaranteeing the trustworthiness of digital repositories, and thus in sustaining the opportunities for long-term data sharing and corresponding services.

In recent years, a number of certification standards and accreditation procedures have been developed worldwide: Data Seal of Approval (DSA), Network of Expertise in long-term Storage and Accessibility of Digital Resources in Germany (NESTOR) seal / German Institute for Standardization (DIN) standard 31644, Trustworthy Repositories Audit and Certification (TRAC) criteria / International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 16363, and the International Council for Science World Data System (ICSU-WDS) certification of WDS Members.

The DSA and WDS certifications both offer a basic certification standard for trusted digital repositories. Their catalogues of requirements and their review procedures are based on the same principles of openness and transparency, and of striking the right balance between simplicity and robustness of the work and effort involved.

Up to this point, the two standards have evolved and operated independently. The primary focus of DSA has been on digital repositories in the Humanities and Social Sciences. For historical reasons, the focus of ICSU-WDS has been on Earth and Space Sciences. Both initiatives, however, have fully multidisciplinary missions.

There are differences between the two organizations that will need to be addressed. For example, ICSU-WDS has a membership focus, and includes not only data centres (mainly repositories) but also data services. Many of these data services consist of a number of components (data centres, analysis centres, product centres, etc.) and have their own organisational structure (e.g., central bureau or governing board). Moreover, the data services often have close linkages with the ICSU Scientific Unions and their Associations. The partnership between DSA and ICSU-WDS will need to handle this complexity.

Under the umbrella of the RDA/WDS Interest Group (IG) on Certification of Digital Repositories, this Working Group (WG)Ñconsisting of representatives from the DSA and WDS communities and beyondÑaims to explore and develop a DSAÐWDS partnership with the objectives of realizing efficiencies, simplifying assessment options, stimulating more certifications, and increasing impact on the community. The output from this WG is envisioned as a possible first step towards developing a common framework for certification and a service of trusted data repositories."
Data Repository Attributes WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/data-repository-attributes-wg,yes,"The Data Repository Attributes Working Group seeks to produce a list of common
attributes that describe a research data repository and to provide examples of the
current approaches that different data repositories are taking to express and expose
these attributes.1
The working group will produce two documentary outputs over the course of 18 months
and four Research Data Alliance (RDA) plenary meetings; they are:
1. a list of common descriptive attributes of a data repository with
a. a definition of each attribute,
b. a rationale for the use and value of each attribute,
c. the feasibility of its implementation,
d. a gap analysis of its current availability from data repositories, and
2. a selection of examples that illustrate the approaches currently being taken by
repositories to express and expose these attributes to users and user agents.
The list of descriptive attributes of a research data repository will be submitted for
review and endorsement to become an RDA Recommendation, and the selection of
exemplars will be submitted for consideration as an RDA Supporting Output. This work
is planned to take place over 18 months between January 1, 2022 and June 30, 2023.
2. Value Proposition
A complete and current description of a research data repository is important to help a
user discover a repository; to understand the repositoryÕs purpose, policies, functionality,
and other characteristics; and to evaluate the fitness for their use of the repository and
the data that it stewards. Many repositories do not provide adequate descriptions in
their websites, structured metadata, and documentation, which can make this
challenging. Descriptive attributes may be expressed and exposed in different ways,
making it difficult to compare repositories and to enable interoperability among
1 This effort was catalyzed by the FAIRsharing WG session on ÒRepository Features Across InitiativesÓ at
the 17th RDA Plenary Meeting.
repositories and other infrastructures such as registries. Incomplete and proprietary
repository descriptions present challenges for stakeholders such as researchers,
repository managers, repository developers, publishers, funders, and registries to
enable the discovery and comparison of data repositories. For example:
? As a researcher, I would like to be able to generate a list of repositories to
determine where I can deposit my data based on a query of descriptive attributes
that are important to me.
? As a repository manager, I would like to know what attributes are important for
me to provide to users in order to advertise my repository, its services, and its
data collections.
? As a repository developer, I would like to know how to express and serialize
these attributes as structured metadata for reuse by users and user agents in a
manner that is integrated into the functionality of my repository software platform.
? As a publisher, I would like to inform journal editors and authors of what
repositories are appropriate to deposit their datasets that are associated with
manuscripts that are being submitted.
? As a funder, I would like to be able to recommend and monitor data repositories
to be utilized in conjunction with public access plans and data management plans
for the research that I am sponsoring.
? As a registry, I would like to be able to easily harvest and index attributes of data
repositories to help users find the best repository for their purpose.
While this is not an exhaustive list of stakeholders and potential use cases, the value of
identifying and harmonizing a list of descriptive attributes of data repositories and
highlighting current approaches being taken by repositories would help the community
address these important challenges and move towards developing a standard for the
description and interoperability of information about data repositories. The statements of
interest below demonstrate that there is a significant interest in this work.
3. Engagement With Existing Work in the Area
Many sets of attributes have been identified by different initiatives with differing scopes
and motivations.2 These attributes have included information about data repositories
such as terms of deposit, subject classifications, geographic coverage, API and protocol
support, funding models, governance, preservation services and policies, openness of
the underlying infrastructure, adherence to relevant standards and certifications, and
2 E.g., Metadata Schema for the Description of Research Data Repositories, Repository Features to Help Researchers: An invitation
to a dialogue, Identifying ELIXIR Core Data Resources, Core Trust Seal, Science Europe, The TRUST Principles for digital
repositories, COAR Community Framework for Good Practices in Repositories, NIH: Selecting a Repository for Data Resulting from
NIH-Supported Research, OpenDOAR Repositories and Metadata Practices, DCAT
more. The results of these efforts reflect the variety of stakeholders and the diversity of
repository attributes of interest across different communities. The harmonization of a
common set of repository attributes, accompanied by the rationale for these attributes,
will provide the community with a clearer understanding of the needs and requirements
of different communities, and this commonality can enable greater interoperability
across repositories, registries, and other data infrastructures.
4. Work Plan
The proposed co-chairs of the working group have submitted a Birds of a Feather (BoF)
session proposal for RDA P18 to engage stakeholders in further discussion around
these issues and revision of this case statement, if necessary. It will meet monthly via
Zoom throughout the 18 months with a rotation of co-chairs formulating and sharing
agendas in advance and leading each meeting. All meetings will be open to the
community and progress towards the two deliverables will be noted on the RDA wiki.
Correspondence between meetings will take place using an RDA mailing list that will be
archived and accessible to all RDA members. The working group will strive to achieve
consensus in its decision-making through open and respectful discussion. All views will
be recorded from the deliberations of the group (e.g., mailing list archive, wiki) for
consideration and community review of its outputs.
The working group will refine its methods based on feedback from the review of this
case statement and member input, but in general we anticipate taking these actions:
1. Identify current standards and approaches to describing data repositories
2. Define use cases/user stories for utilizing metadata about data repositories
3. Draft a list of attributes and the rationale for their use/value
4. Conduct focus groups to validate/refine list
5. Perform an environmental scan to identify exemplars of different approaches
6. Submit a list of data repository attributes as an RDA Recommendation for
broader community input, review, revision, and adoption
7. Submit a selection of exemplars as a RDA Supporting Output
8. Outreach to present and promote the adoption of the outputs
Milestones will include:
1. BoF session at RDA P18 and approval of case statement
2. Monthly meetings commencing January 2022
3. Identification of current descriptive approaches, use case definitions, and first
draft of attributes (Action items 1-3) before RDA P19
4. Environmental scan to identify exemplars, completion and submission of list of
attributes as RDA Recommendation three months after RDA P20
5. Revision of list based on community input and submission of exemplars as RDA
Supporting Output by June 20, 2023
6. After conclusion of working group, presentation of outputs and report of early
adoption at RDA P21
Minimally, the working group will engage the Metadata Interest Group (IG), Domain
Repositories IG, and Repository Platforms for Research IG, and we will explore joint
sessions as needed. Other interest and working groups as well as stakeholders from
outside of the RDA will also be welcomed and encouraged to participate.
5. Adoption Plan
Primary adopters:
1. Repository managers
2. Repository software developers
3. Registries - e.g., FAIRsharing, OpenDOAR, re3data
Consultation and input from both the working group and the broader stakeholder
community will be undertaken to identify
1. the relevance of the descriptive attributes drafted as the first output of the group,
and
2. the feasibility of adopting these characteristics from the perspective of
implementation.
Consultation on attribute relevance will allow an iterative process of development.
Stakeholders will identify the important functionalities they need from repositories (such
as facilitating the data peer review process for publishers and their authors, or
integration with funder review processes); provide the rationale for why these
characteristics are important for their community; and clearly articulate the aspects and
functions needed to support their use cases.
This consultation will ensure that the final version of the list of descriptive attributes will
both represent those repository attributes that are already in use as well as those which
are of most relevance to our stakeholders, who will benefit directly from a harmonized,
common list of attributes, and who will ultimately lead in their adoption and
implementation."
FAIR for Virtual Research Environments WG,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-virtual-research-environments-wg,yes,"One of the major challenges of data-driven research is to facilitate knowledge discovery by
assisting humans and machines in their discovery of, access to, integration and analysis of
data and their associated research objects, e.g., algorithms, software, and workflows. To
address this, an initial effort to define a ""DATA FAIRPORTÓ1 began in 2014 at the Lorentz
workshop and transitioned into developing a set of FAIR Data Guiding Principles2 in 2016.
The FAIR data principles strongly contribute to addressing this challenge with regard to
research data. The principles, at a high level, are intended to apply to all research objects;
both those used in research and those that form the outputs of research. Here we focus on
the adaptation and adoption of the FAIR principles for VREs (Virtual Research
Environments).
Digital objects such as data, software and workflows cannot be made FAIR in isolation -
digital infrastructure is needed to store, manage, analyse and share the digital objects, and
to make them discoverable.
Virtual research environments (VREs), also called science gateways, research platforms or
virtual labs, are increasingly used as the vehicle for collecting or generating digital objects,
processing, analysing, annotating and visualising these, then sharing the research outputs.
VREs are defined here as a broad category of digital research infrastructure that consist of a
set of online services, often with associated integration and/or orchestration functions and
connections to specific data, software, workflow, storage and compute resources. One of the
main drivers for creating VREs is to lower or remove the barrier for researchers in accessing
datasets, performing complex analyses, and sharing their workflows to encourage
reproducibility.
How infrastructure such as a VRE is developed, and the functions it supports, therefore have
a large impact on the FAIRness of digital objects themselves. VREs should enable FAIRness
in the digital objects that they create or produce, and at the very least should not make
digital objects that they process less FAIR.
VREs themselves should also be FAIR, in that they should be easily discoverable and
accessible; should interoperate with other digital research infrastructures; and their technical
architecture, components and services should be reusable to improve development
efficiency.
While some of the high-level FAIR principles as applied to data can be directly applied to
VREs, others are not applicable. Likewise, the recently developed FAIR principles for
2 See also Wilkinson et al., 2016.
1 See also DTL, 2014; and Kok, 2014.
Research Software do not cover all of the aspects of VREs. The application of the FAIR
principles is now also being considered for other areas, including workflows, machine
learning, artificial intelligence (AI), and skills and training.
The FAIR4VREs WG will enable coordination between existing communities working with
VREs, science gateways, platforms and virtual labs, to define what it means for VREs to be
and enable FAIR, and provide guidance to VRE developers in achieving this.
The working group will:
1. Investigate how the existing application of the FAIR principles to data, software,
workflows, computational notebooks, training materials, AI and machine learning
enable VREs to enable FAIR digital objects, and themselves be FAIR, and identify
any gaps in the existing work.
2. Produce guidance on and examples of how VRES can and should be FAIR.
3. Produce guidance on and examples of how VREs can and should enable FAIRness
for other digital objects.
As the working group explores the FAIR ecosystem with respect to VREs, the exact format
of the output(s) will be defined. Rather than producing a set of principles specifically for
VREs, the output(s) will be another connecting piece in the FAIR toolkit between principles
and implementation as they apply to VREs.
2. Value Proposition
The FAIR4VREs WG will identify how VREs can and should be FAIR and also enable
FAIRness for other digital objects, and produce guidance for VRE developers on making
their VRE both FAIR and FAIR-enabling.
This work will be of value to digital infrastructure developers and managers; researchers and
other users of research data; research software engineers and researchers who develop
tools; repository managers; policymakers who are responsible for defining digital policies;
funders of research; and others with an interest in the FAIR principles for all research
outputs.
3. Engagement with existing work in the area
Activities outside RDA
There are specific activities that are underway through the Science Gateways Community
Institute (SGCI, US), the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC, AU), and the
European Open Science Cloud (EOSC, EU). All three of these organisations are working
through the implications of how to apply the FAIR principles to a range of digital objects.
In Australia, the ARDC has developed, or is developing guidelines relating to the FAIRness
of:
? Data
? Software
? Services
? Platforms (equivalent to VREs).
In the US, SGCI is developing guidelines relating to the FAIRness of:
? Science Gateways (equivalent to VREs)
? Research Infrastructures
In the case of software, the principles developed by the FAIR4RS WG will be adopted by the
ARDC, as will the adoption guidelines and implementation plan being developed.
In the case of services, the relevance of the work undertaken by the FAIRsFAIR project
(M2.10 Report on basic framework on FAIRness of services) will be considered as part of
the development of the outputs of this WG.
In the case of VREs, the ARDC and SGCI propose to lead international guideline
development, building on the successful approach taken by the FAIR4RS WG.
FAIRness of research infrastructures combines aspects of FAIRsFAIR project and the SGCI
Tech Summit (https://sciencegateways.org/resources/sgci-tech-summit).
RDA groups
FAIR4VREs WG will also engage with a range of other RDA WGs whose interests overlap,
and ensure that the work of the WG aligns with the work of the other groups. There is a
commitment to engage with co-chairs of relevant RDA groups and members of the following
groups are invited to regularly check our public updates via the mailing list archive .
? VRE IG seeks to build the required technical bridges, skills and social communities
that enable global sharing and processing of data across technologies, disciplines
and countries through the creation of shared online virtual environments. As these
individual VREs grow, inevitably they need to also connect with other major research
infrastructures. This FAIR4VREs WG is sponsored by the VRE IG.
? FAIR4RS WG is enabling coordination of a range of existing community-led
discussions on how to define and effectively apply FAIR principles to research
software, to achieve adoption of these principles. FAIR4VREs will incorporate the
outputs of FAIR4RS.
? FAIR data maturity model WG - working on RDA recommendations for a common set
of core assessment criteria for FAIRness and a generic and expandable
self-assessment model for measuring the maturity level of a dataset.
? CURE FAIR WG - f ocusing on the reproducibility aspect of FAIR for data and code.
Other potential groups to coordinate with include: Go FAIR IG , Exposing Data Management
Plans WG , Active Data Management Plans IG , Research Funders and Stakeholders on
Open Research Data Management Policies and Practices IG , Research Metadata Schemas
WG , FAIR in AI BOF (exploring an IG), and Global Open Research Commons IG .
4. Work Plan
The FAIR4VREs WG will identify how VREs can and should be FAIR and also enable
FAIRness for other digital objects by investigating how the existing applications of the FAIR
principles to digital objects translate to VREs, and identifying any gaps in the existing work.
Guidance will then be developed for VRE developers on making their VRE both FAIR and
FAIR-enabling.
Note that while the group is interested in FAIR metrics and indicators for VREs, this is not in
scope for this WG. We suggest this could be an activity for a follow-on group. We also like to
emphasise that with the early definition of co-chairs to coordinate the work we believe the
deliverables are attainable in a timeline of 18 months from endorsement.

4.2 Working Group Operations
In addition to meeting in-person or virtually at Plenaries, we will have two or more formal
calls in between the Plenaries and share information via a mailing list.
Documents will be created and made public through Google docs and GitHub. This allows
for collaborative work and also serves as a form of communication. Those individuals
actively working on outputs will have ad-hoc virtual meetings as needed (at least monthly).
Trello and Github will be used for planning and tracking group deliverables.
4.3 Addressing Consensus and Conflicts
The WG will adhere to the stated RDA Code of Conduct and will work towards consensus,
which will be achieved primarily through mailing list discussions and online meetings, where
opposing views will be openly discussed and debated amongst members of the group. If
consensus cannot be achieved in this manner, the group co-chairs will make the final
decision on how to proceed.
The co-chairs will keep the working group on track by reviewing progress relative to the
deliverables. Any new ideas about deliverables or work that the co-chairs deem to be
outside the scope of the WG defined here will be referred back to the VRE IG to determine if
a new WG should be formed.
4.4 Community engagement
The FAIR4VREs WG will provide a range of ways for community members to engage at any
of the three levels:
? Co-chairs. The Co-chairs are responsible for leadership of the WG.
? Working and feedback cohort. Community members can choose to engage with the
WG by providing feedback at their preferred pace via the WG RDA space , subgroup
activities and the WG GitHub repo.
? Advocates. Those who can play a key role in endorsing and promoting the outcomes
of this group.
All community members will receive regular updates through the RDA email list . The email
list will facilitate collaborations through invitations to webinars, collaborative documents,
surveys, etc. The WG will organise dissemination about the activities and findings and
gather community feedback regularly during all the phases of the work. All documentation
produced by the group will be publicly accessible via collaborative documents.
5. Adoption Plan
The WG will create an adoption plan for distributing and maintaining the deliverables. A
specific plan will be developed to facilitate adoption of the WG Recommendation within the
organisations and programs represented by WG members. This will include strategies for
adoption more broadly within the global VRE community.
The WG will aim to recruit other potential adopting organisations early in the development
process and ensure that their perspectives inform the guidance, and adoptions would ideally
start within the 18 month timeframe before the WG is complete."
Psychological Data Community of Practice,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/psychological-data-community-practice,yes,"Aligning with RDAÕs mission, the purpose of the Psychology RDA Community of Practice
(CoP) is to raise awareness of the importance of data sharing, and to provide support with
respect to the technical skills needed for FAIR data sharing within the Psychology
community. This CoP brings together Psychology researchers with an interest in open,
transparent, and reproducible research methods and practices. The CoP will link with the
equivalent CoPs in cogent disciplines (e.g., Neuroscience) and with other organisations such
as the UK Reproducibility Network (UKRN), the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), the
Software Sustainability Institute (SSI), Open Life Sciences, and The Carpentries. This CoP
will facilitate the sharing of effective practice, expertise, and computational tools that support
FAIR data sharing.
User scenario(s) or use case(s)
This CoP has emerged as a result of the increasing emphasis in the adoption of open and
reproducible research practices by funders, national, and international bodies. The focus of
the CoP will be primarily on Early Career Researchers who may not have the local support in
place that is needed for the successful adoption of effective and transparent data
management and research management practices.
Objectives
The main objectives associated with this CoP are in terms of providing researchers with the
technical skills needed in order to implement transparent research practices within their own
workflows. These practices include (but are not limited to) pre-registration of research
protocols, the use of open source software for data collection and analysis, reproducible
analysis pipelines (including reproducing system-level dependencies), FAIR data, and
reproducible analysis code associated with research outputs.
Value Proposition
This CoP is aimed at providing Early Career Researchers with the knowledge and skills
needed in order to produce open, FAIR, and transparent research workflows that will
increase the proportion of research results that are fully reproducible by other researchers.
Engagement
This CoP has been proposed by Andrew Stewart (University of Manchester), Etienne
Roesch (University of Reading) and Jim Grange (Keele University). All three are institutional
leads for open and transparent research practices, and sit on the Institutional Leads group of
the UK Reproducibility Network (UKRN). They are all co-investigators on the 5-year
Research England Development (RED) Fund programme of research ÒGrowing and
Embedding Open Research in Institutional Practice and CultureÓ. This £8.5m project aims to
increase the skills base amongst UK researchers (across disciplines) to allow them to adopt
transparent research practices in their own programmes of research. Andrew is also a
Fellow of the Software Sustainability Institute (whose focus is on the recognition of the
importance of research software, including the provision of best-practice software
development skills, in research in the research environment). Both Andrew and Etienne are
qualified Carpentry Instructors. This CoP will interact closely with the UKRN and the SSI. It
will also interact with partners such as ELIXIR-UK (the co-lead for which sits on our advisory
board). Initial activity of this CoP will be funded via the RDA/EOSC Community of Practice
award, and via interactions with other Psychologists within the UKRN.
Outcomes
The main focus of this CoP will be to provide Psychologists with the knowledge and
technical skills needed to adopt effective and open data and research management
practices.
Operational Mechanisms
The CoP will be led in the first instance by Andrew Stewart (University of Manchester),
Etienne Roesch (University of Reading), and Jim Grange (Keele University) with an advisory
board composed of Carole Goble (University of Manchester), Rachael Ainsworth (University
of Manchester), and Shoaib Sufi (University of Manchester). The CoP will meet primarily
on-line on a monthly basis initially. The first yearÕs worth of activities will focus on skills
training in the tools needed for the adoption of open and reproducible research practices."
Neuroimaging Community of Practice,https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/neuroimaging-community-practice,yes,"A detailed articulation of what issues the CoP will address, how this CoP is aligned with
the RDA mission, and how this CoP would be a value-adding contribution to the RDA community.
e-ReproNim fulfils the RDAÕs mission to build the social and technical bridges that enable open sharing and
re-use of data in the domain of neuroimaging. The CoP envisions a neuroimaging research landscape in which
knowledge is generated in a reproducible fashion (in terms of data, analysis and computation) and coupled
with the ability to reuse and extend these studies by others in the community. We aim to shift the way
neuroimaging research is performed and reported, with the development and implementation of technology
that supports reproducibility at the levels of data management, analysis and utilisation for both within- and
between-lab opportunities, including the use of widely distributed and/or large populations to address basic
and clinical research questions. In short, the ReproNim vision is to help neuroimaging researchers: Find and
Share data in a FAIR fashion (discover resources); Comprehensively describe their data and analysis
workflows (describe research processes); and Manage their computational resource options (do analysis).
2. User scenario(s) or use case(s) the CoP wishes to address, and what triggered the desire for this
CoP in the first place.
The stark realisation that scientific results do not always readily replicate has led some to investigate the root
causes of the so-called Òreproducibility crisisÓ. Such self-critical appraisal has been so far more prevalent in
Psychology and Neuroscience than in other disciplines, and typically highlight statistical issues, like
inadequate statistical designs, as well as poor computational training; problems that are only likely to worsen
as data grow larger, become more widely shared, and advanced techniques are imported from fields of
engineering, like machine learning.
Specifically, neuroimaging data, in both clinical and fundamental research, have the particularity that they
involve a large number of processing steps on a very heterogeneous set of equipments and infrastructures,
from the moment they are gathered in proprietary devices (magnetic resonance imaging scanners, electroencephalography
systems, etc) through preprocessing, analysis to annotation, curation and finally deposited
into open repositories for others to use in upstream research. A lot of this pipeline remains an error-prone,
manual process that relies on the researcherÕs voluntary (and unpaid) efforts to acquire an understanding of
the infrastructure available and their technical knowledge to use it, to ensure the traceability and provenance
of the data, the reproducibility and replicability of the work, and the production of FAIR open datasets.
The successful integration of such data into routine neuroimaging practice thus requires neuroscientists to
develop skills that fall outside of ordinary training curricula, which should also include data curation, data
handling, high performance and on-demand computation (in the ÒcloudÓ), semantic web annotation, as well as
statistics suitable for large scale inference. The researchers who have been the most receptive to exploring
and developing such techniques are typically early career researchers, motivated by the desire to learn, apply
and share robust practices. e-ReproNim seeks to alleviate some of the biggest challenges they face: They are
not formally trained and teach themselves these new data practices following online resources, in isolation
and on a voluntary basis.
The CoP thus fills this gap of support, by pooling interests, experiences and expertises into a platform available
globally.
3. Objectives: A specific set of focus areas for discussion and action.
e-ReproNim takes a train-the-trainer approach and aims to create a CoP focusing on 1) creating, consolidating
and providing formal training to fifteen aspiring trainers (ÒEOSC/RDA e-ReproNim FellowsÓ), and 2) engaging
the community in an interdisciplinary examination of the gaps that remain, and identifying the resource and
infrastructures available in Europe, including EOSC and JISC services. Our project is intended to be partnered
with our other CoP proposal (ÒBuilding a Psychology RDA Community of PracticeÓ, coordinated by Dr Stewart),
as well as national, like national Reproducibility Networks (UKRN, FRRN, Swiss RN, etc) and international
partners, like TESS/ELIXIS or the North American sister CoP ReproNim.
4. Value Proposition: A specific description of who will benefit from the creation and animation of the
CoP and what tangible impacts should result
Within the year, fifteen EOSC/RDA e-ReproNim Fellowships will be awarded to early career researchers (ECRs)
in Neuroscience engaged with open and transparent research activities at their home institutions within the
EU and the UK. These fifteen Fellows complement fifteen additional fellows from the EOSC/RDA CoP ÒBuilding
a Psychology RDA Community of PracticeÓ. The RDA fellowships will allow these fellows to 1) fund time for
software and data management training for themselves, and 2) organise training on the principles of software
and data management at their home institutions.
Fellows are selected according to their current role and experience of training students and researchers at
their local institutions, and within the scope of their 1-year fellowship, we expect the Fellows to build from the
support of the CoP to develop a curriculum of training activities they will supervise and conduct themselves.
Additionally, the Fellows will participate in the design and elaboration of online resources, to build the online
presence of the CoP.
Moving forward, we expect the CoP to grow as the train-the-trainer approach leads to more researchers being
able to consolidate their understanding of a robust data practice, and skills in teaching it.
5. Engagement with existing work in the area: A specific description, with tangible outputs and metrics,
of the planned dissemination and communication, outreach and engagement, incentivisation,
endorsement and adoption activities. This area should also address how participation with the
community internal and external to RDA will be established and the plan for collaborative
relationships. Key elements to include are:
¥ A brief review of related work and plan for engagement with any other existing RDA groups;
¥ Eventual new IGs and/or WGs to be proposed directly by the CoP;
¥ Interaction with key stakeholder organisations within the proposed discipline/research domain;
¥ Description of the CoPÕs planned approach to engage with their discipline/research domain and its
key stakeholder organisations and planned approach to encourage broader community engagement
and participation, including proposed ambassadors;
¥ Outline of proposed collaboration and partnerships with industry, associations, organisations and
media as well as discipline/domain-specific funding opportunities.
This CoP has been proposed by Dr Roesch (U. Reading, UK), who acts as Coordinator of the project. He is
helped by Prof Andrew Stewart (U. Manchester, UK, Coordinator of the CoP ÒBuilding a Psychology RDA
Community of PracticeÓ), Dr Michael Dayan (U. Geneva, CH), Dr Karolina Finc (Nicolaus Copernicus U., PL), Dr
Camille Maumet (Inria, FR), Dr Nicholas Hedger (U. Reading, UK) and Dr Romain Valabrgue (Paris Brain
Institute, FR). An Advisory Board provides friendly advice, and includes Prof Carole Goble (U Manchester, UK),
Prof David Kennedy (U. Mass, USA) and Prof Jean-Baptiste Poline (McGill, CA).
All partners on the CoP are involved in both national and international efforts, complementary and in support
of the CoP. These include national Reproducibility Networks, national and international programmes.
e-ReproNim: Building a Neuroimaging RDA Community of Practice
Etienne B. Roesch (Univ. Reading) - 3 -
Specifically, Dr Roesch and Prof Stewart are the main partners involved. They are both co-investigators on the
5-year Research England Development (RED) Fund programme of research ÒGrowing and Embedding Open
Research in Institutional Practice and CultureÓ. This £8.5m project aims to increase the skills base amongst
UK researchers (across disciplines) to allow them to adopt transparent research practices in their own
programmes of research. Andrew is also a Fellow of the Software Sustainability Institute (whose focus is on
the recognition of the importance of research software, including the provision of best-practice software
development skills, in research in the research environment). Dr Roesch is on the UK Reproducibility Network
steering group. Both Dr Roesch and Prof Stewart are UKRN Institutional Leads representing their home
institutions, and both are qualified Carpentry Instructors. Dr Stewart is also a Fellow of the Sustainable
Software Institute. This CoP will interact closely with the UKRN and other national and international
programmes. It will also interact with partners such as ELIXIR (the co-lead for which sits on our advisory
board). Initial activity of this CoP will be funded via the RDA/EOSC Community of Practice award, and via
interactions with other Psychologists within the UKRN.
Both neuroscience and psychology CoP will be hosted on a common platform, to consolidate material and
engagement with the community in Europe and globally. Both CoP will engage with their Fellows and
respective communities according to their own schedule of work, composed of tailored training sessions and
workshops, and at least once a year, will organise a General Assembly with members of the CoPs, to assess
activities and make plans for the future.
6. Outcomes: Outline what the CoP intends to accomplish and how it plans to measure achievement.
Include examples of WG topics or supporting IG-level outputs that might lead to spin off IGs and/or
WGs later on.
The main focus of this CoP will be to provide Neuroscientists with the knowledge and technical skills needed
to adopt effective and open data and research management practices. Activities organised for and by the
fellows will be monitored. Projects that will arise from the CoP will be made available on the website.
7. Adoption Plans (optional): If applicable, please provide specific plans for adoption or
implementation of RDA outcomes within the organizations and institutions represented by CoP
members, as well as plans for adoption more broadly within the community.

8. Operational Mechanisms:
Leadership: Describe how the CoP will be managed, how often it will meet and how it will maintain momentum
between Plenaries. Include details on how the CoP will develop consensus, address conflicts, stay on track
and within scope, and move forward during operation.
Provide a description of the CoPÕs mode and frequency of operation (e.g. on-line and/or on- site, how frequently
will the group meet, be updated, etc.).
This CoP has been proposed by Dr Roesch (U. Reading, UK), who acts as Coordinator of the project. He is

Prof David Kennedy (U. Mass, USA) and Prof Jean-Baptiste Poline (McGill, CA).
Fellows will meet monthly for sustained interaction and community building. Tailored activities, workshops
and training will be organised as and when possible, and include software carpentry workshops, interventions
by partners and other CoPs and projects."
